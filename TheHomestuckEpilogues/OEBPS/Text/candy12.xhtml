      <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">J</span>ake wakes
      up to the unfamiliar feeling of a cheek on his chest and a thigh
      slung over his stomach.</p>
      <p>Not that waking up to limbs entwined with some fleeting
      dalliance was a unfamiliar sensation by any means, but this time
      something seems off. He’s afraid to open his eyes, because he can’t
      remember the last few days. The very last thing he does remember—if
      any of his recollections are to be trusted—is corking open a bottle
      of alchemized merlot at nine in the morning, as one does, and then
      doing a brisk session of target practice, which was interrupted
      by...</p>
      <p>By...</p>
      <p>Oh fuck.</p>
      <p>Jake’s eyes snap open. His ceiling looks the same as it always
      does, if a bit tizzy with the eye-splitting headache sending nails
      of pain through his skull. The gold-flecked flowers carved into his
      wood-paneled ceiling glitter in the morning light. Jake stares very
      hard at them because he doesn’t want to look down and confirm his
      worst fears.</p>
      <p>But his worst fears are confirmed for him without him having to
      do anything, unfortunately, which seems par for the course.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Good morning.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane sits up in the bed and stretches her arms
      over her head. Her body is a perfect hourglass in naked profile.
      Jake’s eyes trace the curve of her spine against his will. They
      linger in the dip above her hips. Her hair is tousled and she’s not
      wearing her glasses. Jake actually has to catch his breath at the
      sight of her. It’s not her attractiveness that was ever in
      question. It’s everything else about this situation which is the
      problem.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane.....</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: What in the blazes happened!?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She turns to face him, giggling into her
      hand.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Why Jake, I would imagine that you are
      practiced enough at sexual congress at this point that I shouldn’t
      have to explain it to you.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane i am quite aware of my reputation but im
      not some loose strumpet who enters into relations
      thoughtlessly!</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, lighten up.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane blinks and touches a hand to her
      collarbone, like she doesn’t quite recognize herself.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh dear, did you hear what I just said?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Lighten up?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: It’s been quite a while since I’ve thought
      that way. My, it feels freeing to say.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Lighten up Jake! The election’s off! The
      economy is stable! Dirk is probably never going to talk to us ever
      again! And we just... we finally fucked. Hoo hoo hoo!</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Did we indeed fuck? Was it merely playing
      honky tonky with our digits, or did we do the ole gamahuche? Or
      even worse, the beardsplitting?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Sigh, I don’t know what any of that means but
      Jake, we definitely did it all.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She crawls towards him with a goofy smile,
      padding along unsteadily because she can’t see shit without her
      spectacles. Jake shoots up in bed and scuttles all the way back,
      until his shoulders hit the frame. Something catches the corner of
      his eye, and he swivels his head around to see the Trickster
      Lollipop on his bedside table. It sits, like evidence at a murder
      scene, beneath an empty bottle of vodka and far more sets of
      underwear than the number of people accounted for in the room.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Um...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">...Jake says, but Jane shuts him up with a
      finger over his lips. She slides into his lap and settles her
      bottom into the space between his thighs. There’s a blanket between
      the lurid parts of their naked bodies, but Jake cannot rightly move
      unless he wishes to be dearly compromised. He stutters through
      several objections, but Jane is plucking all his strings quite
      mercilessly. He feels like a snake about to be necked by a
      mongoose.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Wh... whats the meaning of the lollipop? I
      thought we agreed never to use trickster mode when we were...
      er.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Unsupervised.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: What?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: The lollipop was YOUR idea.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I- I must protest jane that does not seem
      like something that i would agree to in a right state of mind.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Well...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I’m not sure either of us were exactly in the
      right state of mind, to be honest.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: We, er... had quite a bit to drink over the
      course of the day, and one thing led to another...</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Led to partaking in scandalous
      confections?!</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I don’t know what to tell you, Jake. I’m not
      pulling your leg.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: In fact, you were the one doing the vigorous
      leg pulling last night, hoo hoo.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Criminy!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane’s expression falls. She’d been feeling
      quite buoyed after a night of jolly—if inebriated—fun, but Jake
      does not seem to share her enthusiasm.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Dear me... was that innuendo a bit too much?
      I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: No its not that. Jane... i...</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: All of this feels wrong.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Now i dont want you to get the wrong idea
      here youre a dear friend and i care for you deeply but i think that
      what happened between us might have merely been the result of
      profound inebriation.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake regrets the statement as soon as the
      words leave his mouth. Jane looks absolutely crushed. Devastated.
      Like Jake just ripped the rug out from underneath her entire
      universe.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: What?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Are you saying everything we did...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: It...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: It meant nothing to you?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: That. That isnt what i meant. Jane i
      simply....</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane stares up at him, her eyes so bright
      they’re practically clear, like tropical water on a sunny day. She
      looks like girls do right before they’re about to cry.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Jake...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Oh, how could he deny her anything?</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: What was i even saying? Im being terribly
      foolish.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Sure we may have er. Overdone it a bit on the
      substance perhaps...</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: But you know what? To hell with it.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I might not remember everything that happened
      last night but im sure my passions wouldnt lead me astray.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Youve always been a lovely girl jane. And
      youve become an even lovelier woman.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Why its a surprise this didnt happen
      sooner!</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: May as well, er just go with it? Ha ha!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">It’s not the most rousing speech Jake has ever
      given, but it seems satisfactory enough for Jane. He releases a
      tremendously relieved sigh when Jane breaks into a smile.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, Jake!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">He flails when she kisses him. But this time,
      there’s no doubt he hasn’t said no.</p>
