      raining again, coming down in a frigid torrent. John is a
      pallbearer this time around. Teen-Jade is so light, he and Jake
      alone carry the coffin with ease. Together, they trudge through the
      ankle-deep puddles while their friends line up on either side of
      the stone steps that lead into the cathedral.</p>
      <p>It’s just them this time—Earth C’s very own dysfunctional
      collection of Old Gods. John can’t say he misses the clangor of a
      shameless press hounding them from the edges of what is supposed to
      be a somber ceremony. But the smallness of the congregation under
      the tall, gothic ceilings makes Roxy’s attitude at the pulpit all
      the more absurd. She leads John and Jake into the building and down
      the center of the nave, humming happily to herself the entire time.
      An equally effusive Calliope trails behind her, carrying a bouquet
      of purple flowers. Despite Roxy’s insistence that this sad event
      could only bring them all closer together, the group is sitting in
      chilly segments on either side of aisle, pointedly not interacting.
      Karkat is sitting all on his own about six pews behind Jade and
      Dave. Gamzee is hanging out by the door, having been banished there
      by Jane like a wet dog. No one in the cathedral can blame her,
      because he certainly smells like one.</p>
      <p>Roxy, bathed in pink and gold light from the stained glass
      behind her, spreads her arms and begins to speechify. She
      practically has to shout to be heard over the roar of the rainstorm
      outside.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: thx everyone for joining us today</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: we are gathered here to honor the memory of
      alternate universe jade</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: alas we hardly knew her</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: by which i mean we didnt know her at all</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: cuz she fell out of the sky like a week ago
      and was already dead</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: but i think that based on our long
      acquaintanceship with alive jade we can safely assume that she was
      totally rad</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: (ugh)</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: so were all here to contemplate the vast
      cruelness of the universe that such radness was plucked in its
      prime</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: psst callie the roses</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh, of coUrse!</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Calliope begins plucking the petals off her
      bouquet and tossing them in a fluttery, uneven arc over Roxy’s
      impressively coiffed hair.</p>
      <p>John facepalms audibly in the crowd. He’d spent the entire
      morning giving one more go at talking Roxy out of the entire
      affair, but she was stubbornly dedicated to her artistic vision.
      You gave it the old college try chap, Jake said to him earlier as
      he waxed his mustache in the mirror. But its better for a man to
      just let his wife do whatever she wants. I promise youll experience
      less pain that way old boy.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: pUrple roses traditionally represent
      love at first sight, however these roses are actUally red roses
      that we prepared Using a blUe dye.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: the blUe rose is the most elUsive and
      mysterioUs of all flowers.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: the combination of red and blUe in
      this context is meant to evoke the dUal natUre of death, in that
      there is nothing more mysterioUs and impossible to comprehend than
      the vast void of the afterlife, bUt also there is nothing that
      makes Us appreciate the life and and love that we already have than
      the mystery of death.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: while death is terrifying, there is
      always joy to be foUnd among the sorrow. each time we witness
      death, we fall in love with the important people in oUr lives all
      over again.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Calliope is gazing at Roxy with glassy eyes.
      She sniffs as she plucks the last petal from her rose. A breeze
      washes through the cathedral from the crack in the door at the end
      of the room, brushing the petal off-course and causing it to get
      stuck in Roxy’s over-sprayed hair. Calliope reaches out with a
      visibly shaking hand to remove the plant offal, but she does not
      draw back. Instead, she lets her hand graze down the side of Roxy’s
      face and cup her cheek. Roxy puts her own hand over Callie’s and
      holds it.</p>
      <p>John tilts his head and squints at the image in front of him.
      Hmm.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: woah callie thats a beautiful metaphor</p>

      <p class="no-indent">This very tender scene is cruelly interrupted
      by the sound of the cathedral door slamming open.</p>
      <p>Everyone whips their heads around to see, of all people, Aradia
      hovering in the foyer. Her wings radiate a soft, ephemeral glow
      that paints the walls around her pink and red. Sollux is with her,
      feeling his way into the church along the grain of the door. He’s
      soaked head to toe.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      eulogy. Aradia glides to the floor and sets her feet on the stone

      be freed from the ice-cold grip of Jane’s perfectly manicured hand.
      He jumps onto the stage and begins unlatching the coffin while
      Calliope throws more rose petals for some reason. Living-Jade
      slumps in her seat a bit, beginning to look green.</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: but also when you objectively think about it

      lid creaks open and hits the side of the pulpit with a loud crack.
      The noise reverberates through the entire cathedral, shaking dust
      off of the unused pews and rattling the iron in the stained-glass
      windows. Outside, a clap of thunder follows.</p>
      <p>Aradia vaults into the air and flits over the pews to get a
      better look at the body. Teen-Jade remains in the bloody Space
      outfit she crashed to Earth in, since nobody was willing to
      dislodge the huge, otherworldly shard from her chest in order to
      change her. But Roxy has done the corpse’s makeup beautifully, and
      fashioned her a lovely flower crown. If not for all the blood caked
      down her front, and her conspicuous impalement, she’d look like she
      was merely sleeping.</p>

      beneath the startled looks she’s receiving from the rest of the

      <p class="roxy">ROXY: look everyone im not dumb ok even tho i act
      like it sometimes</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i know whats goin on here</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: that were all drifting apart</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: and i know thats just a normal part of
      growing up and making new families</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: and i guess learning that some people have
      unbridgeable divides on political stuff</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i can accept that things arent gonna always
      be the same as when we first met</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: specially with dirk gone</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: damn...</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: even though its been more than a year i still
      feel it like he died yesterday</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: what callie said earlier about death being
      mysterious and full of love is true</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i dont know if i ever would have gotten up
      the courage to marry john if dirk hadnt died</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: sometimes i think about what it would have
      been like if he was still here</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i think we can all agree that if dirk didnt
      kill himself there would be some big differences in the lives of
      people here in this room</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i cant say if theyd be good or bad</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: maybe when it comes to this kind of thing...
      like</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: infinite probability and multiple universes
      and shit</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: good and bad dont matter</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: theres no better or worse just different</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: even with dead jade here whos to say that the
      world she came from was actually worse than ours?</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: she probably died a heroic death doin
      something incredible</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: we probably only have the great lives we do
      right now because of her sacrifice</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: the universal odds of us all being alive and
      healthy and together like this are so infinitesimally low that its
      literally impossible for us to understand with our limited linear
      consciousness</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: isnt that amazing??</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: so even if this is the last time were all
      ever in the same room like this</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i think its just incredible we could be here
      in the first place</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: out of a sempiternal number of possibilities
      we are the only incarnation of this exact specific moment in all of
      existence</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i think that we should all look around and be
      super grateful for what we</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: wh... what we</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: wh... wha...</p>

      <p class="no-indent">John stumbles up the stairs to the pulpit,
      holding his head with both hands. It’s actually Jake, still
      dutifully standing next to the corpse, who catches Roxy under the

      whips up a cushion of wind for her to recline on.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Calliope begins sprinting after John and Roxy
      but doesn’t make it two steps before something stops her in her
      tracks. A feeling that crawls under her exoskeleton. She stands
      deathly still for a moment, and then turns to face the coffin.
      Something about the corpse has transfixed her. She curls her
      fingers around the rim of the casket and leans in, studying
      teen-Jade’s peaceful face.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the corpse bolts upright. Calliope yelps and falls on
      her butt. Adult-Jade screams.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jade">JADE: AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Hair veiling her face, teen-Jade sets her
      hands on her chest and dissolves the shard bisecting her ribcage.
      The wound does not heal, but it doesn’t bleed either.</p>

      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: jade! yoU...</p>

      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: yoU’re not dead!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">It takes the corpse a while to reply. Everyone
      waits for her to speak. When the words leave her mouth, they send a
      chill through the cathedral air.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i am not jade.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Slowly, Jade raises her head. The stage makeup
      Roxy applied earlier is running down her face in dark rivers. Her
      eyes are solid black. Even more than black, it seems. They are
      hollows penetrating deep into a field of absence so profound, it’s
      hard to imagine a single photon has ever crossed through its
      infinite expanse. Meeting her gaze is like peering into a realm
      where light goes to die. Calliope finds the sensation disturbingly
      familiar.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: then who...</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: who are yoU?</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you know who i am, calliope.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: we met once, years ago.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you were dead, and so was i.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Calliope now understands exactly who is
      speaking to her. She tenses up, scuttles backward, and begins
      tumbling down the stairs into the aisle. She starts running before
      she’s even up on both feet, clawing the carpet ragged in her
      desperation to escape the cathedral. The congregation watches her
      go, but no one moves to help her, or even looks in her direction.
      In her wake, she leaves a primal, echoing wail. The door closes
      thunderously behind her. Her scream can be heard beyond the doors,
      growing quieter as she recedes into the distance.</p>
      <p>Kanaya adjusts the buttons on her very fashionable mourning
      gloves and sighs.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      <p class="no-indent">Teen-Jade floats out of her coffin with
      measured grace. Adult-Jade shudders as her reanimated duplicate
      passes by. She slides back into Kanaya’s comforting arms and hides
      her face in the crook of her neck. Teen-Jade directs her
      pitch-black eyes toward the arched marble ceiling, and gazes
      skyward with a sort of intensity and purpose nobody in this crowd
      has seen in years. It’s as if her glare is passing through the roof
      of the church and continuing unimpeded through the partitions of
      this very plane of reality itself.</p>

      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you’re undoubtedly surprised.</p>

      eons of existence.</p>
