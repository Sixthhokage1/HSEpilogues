      <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: the timelines are interacting
      again.</p>
      <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ooh do you hear anything interesting</p>
      <p class="sollux">SOLLUX: don’t be s0 n0sy aradia.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Aradia throws her legs over the edge of the
      ancient meteor facility and kicks them out into open space. Far
      below her feet, the meteor is wildly overgrown. It landed here
      millions of years ago, after its fateful three-year journey when it
      hosted several trolls and humans as they had a variety of critical
      coming-of-age experiences. It will stay here for millions more
      years, where it will remain indefinitely on a barren, desolate
      Earth C, waiting to host a single cherub child, chained to its
      bedroom. But for now, it hosts these three.</p>
      <p>Dead-Jade, whose body also happens to be hosting a cherub at the
      moment, is doing the same thing she does every day: sitting with
      her legs crossed and her eyes closed, using her still-teenage body
      to scry into the abyss. The light from the outer rim of the
      stratosphere casts her face in powdery blue light. It’s certainly a
      more becoming avatar for Calliope, most would find. The Calliope
      who Roxy calls a friend, in her moments of greatest self-reproach,
      would die for a body like this. The version of Calliope who’s been
      dead for eons, however, waiting for exactly this moment in history
      to reinstate her corporeal presence, couldn’t care less about her
      host’s appearance. It is simply serving as a functional vessel for
      the crucial role she now must play.</p>
