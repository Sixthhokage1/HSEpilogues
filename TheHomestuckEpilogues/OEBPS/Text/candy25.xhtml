      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Karkat winces as the ground above him shakes
      and a scattering of dirt and debris rains down from the roof of the
      cave. His fledgling rebellion has found cover in the spiderweb
      network of tunnels running to and from the troll capital originally
      built to accommodate the transit of incestuous slurry from the
      boonies to the Mother Grub. Though technically regarded as a
      critical infrastructure project, the caves have never been used or
      appropriately surveyed by the world government. Back when all were
      on better terms, Jane was gracious enough to believe the maps
      Kanaya handed over were anything approaching accurate. With the
      tunnel entrances at the brood pit sealed, the rebellion was safe
      for now. But the presidential drones were testing the grounds
      relentlessly: closer and closer every day now.</p>
      <p>It’s not the dirt that’s bothering him. Dirt is something you
      get used to, living hand-to-mouth inside a cave. It’s that
      persistent fucking leak directly above his desk that is driving him
      to distraction.</p>

      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SO FAR ALL THIS “TROLL REBELLION” HAS
      AMOUNTED TO IS A WHOLE LOT OF DICK ALL, WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIDE

      MAKING A COMPLETE ASS OF HIMSELF.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Karkat gestures toward the display screen
      showing a commercial for the next episode of <em>Doing the
      Charleston with Notable Social Figureheads: Stars Versus Enemies of
      the State, with Your Host Jake English.</em> Swifer’s taciturn
      broodmate Cliper is indeed making an absolute fool of himself in
      the recap from the previous week’s show, failing to keep time with
      the jaunty beat and struggling to knock his knees together with the
      required vigor. The fact that he is shackled at the wrists doesn’t
      seem to be helping.</p>

      PROTECT THE COMMON PEOPLE?</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Karkat throws both hands in the air
      melodramatically. A drop of stale water plops off one of his nubby
      little horns.</p>

      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU KNOW, RIGHT ABOVE THE PLACE WHERE WE

      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Well sir you told me to “take care of it”

      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THEN WHY IS IT STILL LEAKING?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Oh. By “fix” you meant that you wanted me
      to plug the crack!</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT THE HELL DID YOU THINK I MEANT?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: I thought you meant for me to mop up the
      water that had gathered...</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: And then use that water to swif the
      bejeebus out of the floors.</p>

      did.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Karkat gapes at her, open-mouthed. She grins
      back, unaware of any mistake on her part. The only thing he can do
      is bury his face in his palms.</p>

      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OH MY GOD.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: GROW THE FUCK UP, EGGMOP.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">He stalks past his blushing assistant with a
      belabored sigh. Karkat has lived with humans for so long that he’s
      grown used to seeing buckets regularly defiled. Now that he thinks
      about it, he realizes Jade has used more buckets to grow snap peas
      in her living room than any troll has used for the purposes of
      reproduction in the entire history of Earth C. The bucket taboo is
      largely emblematic at this point. An empty signifier for an
      endangered culture.</p>
      <p>As he stomps through the winding tunnels, thinking very hard
      about this incredibly tragic thing, his speaker crab crackles to
      life.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Karkat makes extra-triple sure that he’s
      actually hung up on Kanaya for real this time, by fiddling with the
      tiny claw on his speaker crab until it’s in the off position. The
      action of tuning his outdated wristwatch is interrupted by another
      earthquake rumbling around him. This one sounds different, however.
      He knows the sound of a drone strike like the back of his hand by
      now. It’s a low, creeping bellow that pulses through the ground in
      waves. This sounds more like an impact that left a crater. The last
      time something struck the planet that hard, it was Jade’s creepy
      undead corpse.</p>
      <p>Karkat runs for the nearest exit and cautiously pokes his head
      out into the clearing above. There’s a figure in the smoke: her
      stumbling silhouette includes an unmistakable pair of horns. She
      takes two steps out of her crater before falling flat on her face
      again. Karkat runs to help her, putting her arm over his shoulders
      and dragging her out of the dust cloud from the impact.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      <p class="no-indent">Meenah blinks up at him with a pair of eyes
      that seem different to him somehow, but he can’t put his finger on
      it. He has to admit, it’s been a long time since he saw her. She
      seems singed, woozy, but mostly undamaged.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Karkat continues inspecting her without much
      concern for coming across as weird. He knows something’s off about
      her, he just can’t figure out what. Then a reflective gleam catches
      his eye. A gold ring on her finger. He glances back up to look in
      her eyes. They aren’t blank, like all the other fallen ghosts’ eyes
      are.</p>
