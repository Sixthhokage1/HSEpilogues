      <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">Y</span>es,
      something feels <em>very</em> different.</p>
      <p>Dirk’s hands begin to shake, so violently that he drops his
      screwdriver into the chassis of the battle bot he’s working on. It
      clangs around for a bit, landing somewhere that will doubtlessly be
      very inconvenient to retrieve. It doesn’t matter. There’s no more
      time for rap battles, or politics, or wacky hijinks of an
      adventurous nature. There’s no time left for anything.</p>
      <p>Moisture beading at his temples, Dirk staggers away from his
      workbench and braces himself against the wall. His knees are weak,
      head spinning, palms so sweaty that the concrete feels smooth under
      them. He nearly drops his phone while attempting to dramatically
      autodial Jane’s number through the haze of his trembling, sudorific
      stupor.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hey, Jane. Bad news.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Cancel everything.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Excuse me, what?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: All plans.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Cancel them.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s over.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: What’s over, Dirk?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I just told you. Everything.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Because we’re canceling it.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Dirk, are you quite okay?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, I’m cool.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: You sound terrible.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: It’s unlike you to call quits on a caper like
      this without offering a lengthy diatribe on it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Lengthy diatribes are over too.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: They’re canceled.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane gasps loudly, without a hint of
      irony.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: I don’t understand.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Don’t worry about it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Just do what I say.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">He hangs up on her and brings up his contacts
      so that he can text Jake and cancel all their televised fights for
      the foreseeable <em>forever</em>. He then blocks Jake’s number,
      because if it’s not worth explaining to Jane, it’s definitely not
      worth explaining to Jake. Then again, nothing is ever really worth
      explaining to Jake. Jake’s number is barely even worth storing in
      his phone, if Dirk is being perfectly honest.</p>
      <p>Through the workshop window, Dirk can see the sun touching the
      horizon. Ah, exquisite: he takes a moment to appreciate the sublime
      synthesis of the atmosphere and the existential crisis he is
      currently experiencing. The sun is setting both physically and
      metaphorically right now. <em>Not bad</em>, he thinks, then
      corrects himself, because while there is always time to delight in
      the volatility of causality, the whole situation is actually and
      for real <em>astonishingly</em> bad.</p>
