      <p class="no-indent">Vriska cups her hand around the receiver of
      her phone and shouts over the artillery barrage.</p>

      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I Implored You To GUESS WHERE I 8M!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: uh. hmm. based on the horrible
      racket in the background, i’m gonna guess... the battle outside the
      city?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Ha HA! I TOLD you my moms were going to
      Hook Me The Fuck Up with a sweet milit8ry commission!</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I’m officially in the rebellion,

      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: ugh. i’m watching the battle out
      my window right now. are you SURE it’s safe for you to be out

      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: i’d kind of hate it if you died
      before we got to third base.</p>

      Immortal, bitch.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I’m gonna 8reeze through here like a High
      Money Roller getting sweepstakes at the 8lackj8ck table!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: you should probably actually
      gamble once in your life before you try to make gambling metaphors,
      babe. because that was dire.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Uh, excuse you, but Tavros tot8lly snuck
      me into Uncle Jake’s poker game last month. It was Immoderately
      LIT.</p>

      tavros?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Uhhhhhhhh... yeah? Why wouldn’t I

      Anderson.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: how do you stand kissing him? he’s
      so weird. and always mysteriously sticky for some reason.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: PLEASE tell me you haven’t gone to
      third base with him.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: A girl Does Not kiss and tell, Harry
      de8rest. ::::)</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: okay well as long as you don’t
      touch me after feeling up his weird, clammy body.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I’m not going to get a chance to feel
      either of you up for A While, considering I’m now an Important
      8aller in Karkat and Meenah’s 8adass Revolutionary Army.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Oh, I asked if they could squeeze you in.
      They s8id they were JUST out of openings.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Sorry Dude! Lol.</p>

      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Ugh, who knows.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Oh. your DAD is here.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: what?!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: i thought he didn’t want anything
      to do with the war?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Yeah, well, he S8YS that, but he’s here
      right now and my mom’s saying a bunch of G8y Shit to him.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: They’re hugging and Reminiscing a8out how
      Old And Sad they are or wh8tever.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: huh...</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: What?</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: i really thought that my father

      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Welp!</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Them’s The Br8ks, Kid.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: man.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: you can be such a shitty
      girlfriend sometimes.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: May8e I’m inspired to be a Less Than
      Ideal M8tesprit when I’m in the presence of WEAKNESS? Ever consider
      that??</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: unbelievable.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Hey I’m just fucking with you! Don’t 8e

      much. Maybe chill out?</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: yeah whatever.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: he’s always getting all weepy
      whenever i talk to him anyway.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: i don’t think i could have taken
      another round of him choking back tears while apologizing to me
      about “what happened with me and your mother, harry.”</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: i mean, god. he’s not even fucking
      DRUNK when he does this.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: that might actually be the most
      embarrassing part.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Yeah, lmao.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Now th8t you mention it, I think he’s
      actually crying right now?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I think I can overhear...</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: W8it.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Vriska stops trying to eavesdrop on John’s
      blubbering for a moment. She’s distracted by another noise. She
      whips her head around to detect an all-too-familiar sound echoing
      above the post-bombing silence. It’s a sound that she knows from
      hard-won experience can mean only one thing.</p>
      <p>There’s a clown nearby.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I think I hear...</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: GAMZEE??</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: gamzee? my auntie jane’s
      gamzee?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Yes! Who ELSE could I mean?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: He’s around here somewhere.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: so what? i see him every day. he
      sucks.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: So WH8T?! He’s like, Jane’s left hand
      man!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: no, he’s “neutral,” remember?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: That’s not how Comm8nder Vantas
      feels.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: He says he’s a total 8astard. A Tr8itor
      To His Kind.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: yawn.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">The dust is beginning to settle around
      Vriska’s ankles. She scans the tree line and brings all her
      attention to bear on this curious rhythm of noises coming from
      nearby, beckoning from the underbrush. She pushes toward it through
      the thorny shrubbery.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: There’s a bounty out for his arrest!
      D8mn, they’ll probably put him in front of a tribunal if we can get
      our hands on him!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: oh, i changed my mind. this sounds
      good actually.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: invite me to the execution,
      please?</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: If I could c8pture the High Fucking
      Priest Makara they’d promote me to, like, third in command of the
      whole joint!!!!!!!!</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Fuck YE8H!</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: well.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: good luck with all that.</p>
      <p class="harry">HARRY ANDERSON: call me if you wanna hook up after
      the battle.</p>
      <p class="vriska">VRISKA: N8turally!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">John’s wiping away a tear with his sleeve when
      he catches sight of Vriska, innocently wandering toward the very
      bush where he’d just abandoned (Vriska) to sort out her confusing
      exhibition of unexpected and deeply profane lust. Now that the
      battle has stilled, he can overhear the vile melody of the
      blasphemous union.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s that noise again.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I knew I wasn’t imagining it.</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: oh no.</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: no, no, no...</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: VRISKA, WAIT, DON’T!!!!!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">John runs to intervene, but it’s too late.
      Vriska pushes aside the last of the fronds separating her from her
      quarry with a triumphant Ha!</p>
      <p>Vriska’s huge, mischievous smile freezes on her face. When her
      eyes pass the image to her brain, and it finally makes sense of
      this incomprehensible jumble of gray limbs, blue and purple slop,
      tangled black hair, and stunned faces, her expression begins to
      slowly melt. It then drifts quickly, from phase to phase, to one of
      wonder, then anguish, and finally, abject horror.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: oh god.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Vriska and (Vriska) both start shrieking at a
      pitch John’s only ever heard one time before. It was a sound that
      once accompanied the end of everything. A sound once heard the
      night he dreamt in anime.</p>
