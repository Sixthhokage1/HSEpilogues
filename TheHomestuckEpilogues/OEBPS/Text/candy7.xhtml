      <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">J</span>ohn’s been
      spending a lot of time with Roxy lately. Which also means spending
      a lot of time with Calliope, which is awkward, but fine. But it
      also means spending a lot of time with Gamzee, which is awkward,
      and not even remotely fine.</p>
      <p>John, Roxy, and Calliope are taking a stroll through downtown
      New Prospit. Gamzee’s here too, a couple feet behind John, doing
      essentially the same thing that the other three are doing. Which is
      walking at a leisurely pace, but he’s being so weird about it that
      you can’t really call it strolling. It’s more like he’s... holding
      court, while somehow remaining in motion. Ever since he popped out
      of that fridge smelling like a sweaty foot, he’s been all “wise”
      and “sage-like.” John considers that if he were using these two
      descriptors out loud, he’d make air quotes while saying them. He’d
      then say Gamzee’s acting almost like a “priest,” which is a word he
      would also make air-quotes around, due to how insanely full of shit
      John still believes him to be.</p>
      <p>Roxy and Calliope, however, apparently do not believe him to be
      full of shit, for some reason.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: isn’t that nice?</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: huh?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Gamzee is leading a line of adoring
      carapacians trailing behind him, telling them stupid, fake-zen
      stuff like “YoU GoTtA sToP tO sMeLl ThE sEeD fRoNdS mY dUdEs.” Not
      to be speciesist or anything, but the sight is kind of worrying
      because John knows all too well how susceptible carapacians are to
      grassroots populism. He has it on good authority that virtually any
      schmuck can blunder into a crowd of them, say a few inspirational
      words, and incite revolutionary fervor amongst the masses. John
      tries his best to ignore it and walk ahead, but Roxy loops her arm
      through his and pulls him back.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: were here check it</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: where’s here?</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: me n callies fave cafe!!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">It’s a nice place. Big, oval windows, flowers
      on all the tables. It’s got a French-ish aesthetic. John says “ish”
      because everything on Earth C is sort of “ish.” “Alternian-ish,”
      “Derse-ish,” “Japanese-ish.” He’d even describe the sky as being
      kind of “blue-ish.” Sometimes, it’s more turquoise than anything.
      Too crisp and bright, like the old Earth’s sky as seen through a
      pair of tinted novelty glasses.</p>
      <p>John doesn’t mean to be cynical about it, but he guesses that’s
      just the mood he’s in. Maybe it has something to do with the fact
      that Calliope insisted on including an unbelievably smelly clown on
      an otherwise perfectly pleasant stroll.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: that’s it? we’re going to a coffee shop?</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: i got out of bed for THIS?</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: lmao</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh john ur so FUNNY</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: no seriously roxy i just...</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, i feel like i haven’t left my house
      in years, and with all the stuff that’s been going on, like rose’s
      illness, or that stuff about the “political situation,” is it
      really a good idea for us to be having picnics and going out to
      coffee shops?</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh john, don’t worry so mUch aboUt
      things that yoU have no control over.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: like i said the other day, it’s time
      for Us to leave Ugly things behind Us.</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea for real john cant u just enjoy what a
      beautiful day it is</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: i know IM enjoyin it</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: since i get to spend it with u like ive
      always been wanting</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: you... you have?</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: yeah duh</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She tugs him against her side and rests her
      head on his shoulder. She’s a bit taller than him in her nice
      shoes, so it’s kind of awkward. Feels uncomfortable to him, and
      looks more so for her. But he’s enjoying the attention. Sort of. He
      missed her, the way she used to be, when the two of them were close
      as kids. She’s laying it on a little thick for his benefit right
      now, and while he can appreciate that, it can be difficult to
      rekindle a friendship after it’s gone cold for a while. John wishes
      the rekindling period would hurry up and end already so they can
      just go back to shooting the shit like normal.</p>
      <p>Roxy drags him into the cafe. Calliope doesn’t follow them in,
      for reasons he can only guess at. He catches a glimpse of her
      through the window: a little forlorn, Gamzee at her side like a
      faithful dog. He can’t hear what they’re saying.</p>
      <p>Outside, Calliope clasps her hands and directs a wistful
      expression through the cafe window, foot traffic splitting lazily
      around her and Gamzee as they stand in the busy street. At high
      noon, her little body casts almost no shadow on the cobblestone
      road.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: sigh.</p>

      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: can’t yoU see what’s happening with
      roxy and john?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Gamzee stares through the window. Roxy is
      leaning across the table to dab at the corner of John’s mouth with
      a napkin. John looks very confused, because they aren’t actually
      eating anything yet. Gamzee stares at this for a very long time,
      his mouth lolling open as he contemplates what is transpiring with
      the closest facsimile to wisdom he can muster. He puts one of his
      huge hands on Calliope’s narrow shoulder, all comforting-like.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Gamzee leans in so that his face is level with
      Calliope’s. His grin shows every single one of his teeth.
      Miraculously, his breath smells worse than his body.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: MOTHERFUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: gamzee, no, please! it’s fine.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i might be sad, bUt john has made his
      choice, and we mUst all live with the repercUssions of that.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i’m sUre that roxy will be very happy
      with him.</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: we’re all going to be very, very
      happy. I trUly believe that. ^u^</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Calliope walks away, looking somewhat less
      than very, very happy. Gamzee remains standing in front of the
      cafe, still not entirely convinced that he shouldn’t motherfucking
      do something about it.</p>
      <p>John notices him there, just outside the window, leering at him
      and Roxy. His expression is serene, vacant. Calliope is nowhere to
      be seen.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: um, hey roxy...</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: wats up</p>

      creeping me out.</p>

      <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea dont worry about that he gets stuck like
      that sometimes</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Roxy takes a sip of her tea. Her purple
      lipstick leaves a stain on the fine china.</p>

      <p class="roxy">ROXY: wat a tragic misunderstood figure :’(</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Roxy sighs and spears the cherry atop her
      cheesecake with the absurdly tiny dessert fork it was served with.
      She pops it in her mouth with a pouty little lip pop, staring
      directly at John with her eyes half-lidded. He thinks she might be
      trying to be sexy, but he’s a bit distracted by the sight of Gamzee
      lumbering into the cafe with all the grace of an aubergine
      sasquatch sporting an epic erection. He puts both hands on the back
      of Roxy’s chair and looms over her. Without breaking eye contact
      with John, Roxy scoops up a spoonful of cheesecake and feeds it to
      him.</p>

      greater ensemble if ur given the chance</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">John attempts to furtively gesture his
      disapproval with the entire situation toward Roxy by vaguely
      swiping his neck in a horizontal direction with his fingers, but
      she doesn’t notice. Instead she puts her fork down, slides her
      chair out, and springs to her feet with an abundance of this
      newfound enthusiasm he’s been struggling to understand.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: brb!</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">John and the date’s repulsive third wheel
      watch as she scurries to the back of the establishment. The moment
      the door to the bathroom closes, Gamzee lumbers into a sitting
      position across the table from John, without the slightest
      deviation in his heinously awkward comportment. He puts his
      forearms on the table in front of him, folds his hands, and gazes
      into John’s eyes with what he has come to identify as Gamzee’s
      signature brand of faux serenity.</p>

      service, in the hopes that it will provide a social buffer for the
      appalling interaction that is presently taking place. But no
