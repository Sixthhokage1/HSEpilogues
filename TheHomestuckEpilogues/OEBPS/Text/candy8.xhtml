      <p class="rose">ROSE: Did you hear that Jane had been intending to
      run for president?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes She In Fact Asked Me To Serve A
      Position In Her Cabinet</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: On The “Board Of Responsible Troll
      Reproduction”</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh dear. What did you tell her?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Not In So Many Words</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: But I Told Her To Kindly Fuck Off</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose arches an eyebrow at her wife, who is
      tending to the Mother Grub. Rose herself is sitting cross-legged on
      an outcropping over the lip of the breeding pit, knitting a series
      of tiny scarves for the grub clones that she and Kanaya have come
      to help hatch.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: That bad, huh?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: She Was Already Talking About Regulating
      Troll Reproduction</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: With Great Confidence I Might Add As If
      She Had Already Been Elected</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Very presumptuous of her.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well I Suppose Her Confidence Was Not
      Unearned</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Who Was Going To Run Against Her</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Karkat?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Kanaya laughs to herself, more fond than
      mocking. Rose turns over another row on her scarf with dexterous
      ease, switching the knit pattern without missing a stitch. From
      behind her knitting she watches Kanaya check the shell thickness on
      a batch of eggs. Her wife is luminous in the early morning light,
      her rainbow-drinker skin soaking in the pink light and reflecting
      it back like the inside of a snail’s shell.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think Karkat would be such a bad
      candidate actually. Depending on certain factors I mean.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m assuming that in this theoretical
      scenario, Dave is handling the economy.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh Of Course</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Ok. In that case it might have all worked out
      in the end.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Doubtlessly</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Have Great Faith In Karkat And Always
      Have</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: However I Also Am Not Certain That He
      Could Step Out Of His Hive Without Catching On Fi–</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Swifer Could You Not Swiff The Mother
      Grub So Vigorously</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Oh, sorry ma’am!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Swifer Eggmop is Kanaya’s over-eager but
      well-meaning jade-blooded assistant. She talks a little like a
      parody of a 1920s newsboy archetype, which Rose can only theorize
      has to do with Jane’s influence on the culture.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Just tryin’ to get her nice and clean! I
      heard the New Prospit Hornographer’s coming by later to scope out
      some pics!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Swifer is at the center of the breeding pit,
      knee-deep in birthing juice as she mops down the Mother Grub’s
      exoskeleton. The parturition of troll grubs is apparently an
      arduous and grisly task, one that has stained the Mother Grub’s
      shimmering white exoskeleton rainbow-dark with various
      secretions.</p>
      <p>Rose takes a moment to feel grateful that her current
      relationship alignment leaves no chance for her to ever be “human
      pregnant.” Not that she has any particular distaste for motherhood.
      It might be nice to adopt a little troll grub once the whole ball
      on natural production gets rolling.</p>
      <p>Swifer adjusts the rate of her swiffing to a more acceptable
      level of vigor. She shines up the last of the segment she’s working
      on, then twirls the mop over her wrist with a martial flourish that
      absolutely recalls the fact that she is from a natural-born warrior
      species. She then gets to work washing the Mother Grub’s horns.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: What’s this about the Hornographer?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Since when has the press taken in interest in
      our activities down here?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh Yes You Were Busy Dying When I Set All
      Of That Up</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: The Mother Grub Is Mature Enough This
      Year To Process Inseminated Slurry For The First Time In Our
      History</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: If The Government Gives Us The Go Ahead
      We Can Begin Breeding Trolls The Natural Way Next Month</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Arranged The Newspaper Story
      When...</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: When Jane asked you to sit on the “Board for
      Responsible Troll Reproduction”?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes The First Thing I Did Immediately
      After Screaming Into A Pillow Was To Call My Acquaintance At The
      Paper</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Now That She Isnt Running It Doesnt Seem
      Very Important However</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Actually Im Not Terribly Interested In
      Politics At All</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Without Anger Motivating Me I Began To
      Think About How Its Probably Very Irresponsible For Any Of Us To
      Use Our Influence In Such A Way</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I agree. In fact, I’d just assumed that most
      of us had arrived at such a conclusion.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Not Jane Apparently</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Or Dave, I’m sorry to say.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">There’s a third member of their social group
      who definitely hasn’t arrived at the conclusion that his power and
      influence should be meted out responsibly either. Neither of them
      speak his name, however. For some reason, it feels like a shadow
      passing over the sun. A brief spike of pain flickers through Rose’s
      head, a bolt that strikes between her eyes and splinters out. There
      is color and light behind it. A vision that tears through the
      material reality in front of her and gives her a brief glimpse into
      a parallel reality where things are very different.</p>
      <p>It’s gone as soon as she notices it. The image never
      materializes. She ties off the last row of her scarf and unwinds
      her knitting needles from the wool, a serene smile tugging at her
      lips. Since waking up in the hospital, she has stopped worrying
      altogether about what might be happening in splintered timelines.
      She has stopped worrying, in fact, about almost anything at all. A
      pleasant breeze rustles through her hair, carrying the sweet scent
      of early spring from the mouth of the chasm. Rose closes her eyes
      for a moment and breathes it in: taken just one minute at a time, a
      day can be filled with hundreds of perfect moments.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Whatever Inconvenient Party Ruining
      Opinions Dave and Jane Might Have About The Economic Future Of Our

      <p class="rose">ROSE: Hmm... Did you really use dialogue like that
      to win my heart, or are we getting complacent and incredibly uncool
      in our old age?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Convinced You To Marry Me I Dont Think
      That I Am Obligated To Be Cool Anymore</p>

      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Sure Isnt You</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Ma’am and Ma’am’s wife! Bank’s closed,
      ladies!</p>
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: The first egg is hatchin’ already!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Kanaya twirls on her heel, skin flickering
      bright as she lifts her skirt and jumps into the breeding pit. Rose
      sets down her needles and follows, walking along the edge of the
      pit to the place closest to the eggs. She crouches to watch the
      miracle of life begin.</p>
      <p>She’s never taken the time to come down here before and see the
      grubs hatch. Probably because she’s been too busy diminishing
      melodramatically on the couch to take an active interest in her
      wife’s life calling. The grub is already chewing through the chitin
      eggshell with all its little legs moving sinuously in offbeat
      concert.</p>
      <p>Swifer is sniffling. She makes the motion of wiping away a tear,
      somewhat cartoonishly.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Golly gee oh my. This part always makes
      me tear up.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Kanaya dips down to help the grub out of the
      shell. Her skirt trails through a puddle of birthing jelly, but she
      doesn’t seem to care. There’s an awed expression lighting up her
      face, in addition to the literal light emanating from her skin. She
      tears away the last chunk of the shell. It’s mottled and rough,
      like a rock on the outside, but has a layer beneath like mulched
      flesh. Kanaya’s hands are soaked blue with bloody yolk when she
      finally lifts the grub and holds it up to the light.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose Look</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose looks. All troll grubs appear kind of
      samey, but this one has a familiar look about her. Asymmetric
      horns, one crescent, the other harpoon-like. A mussed mane of hair
      and a mischievous glint in her beady little eyes. Particularly the
      one with seven pupils.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: ...</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Vriska?</p>

      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: This Brood Has Been Utilizing A Slurry

      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: But Sometimes Very Close Copies Occur</p>

      <p class="rose">ROSE: So... Vriska would be this troll’s
      ancestor?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Wow.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose I Think This Is A Sign</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: A sign of what?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Havent We Been Talking About Adopting A
      Grub</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Eventually, yes. But a natural-born grub.
      Don’t you think it will be somewhat... awkward, us raising a clone
      of your sort-of ex?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: What happens when Vriska comes back? What do
      we say to her?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose Vriska Is Dead So It Doesnt Really
      Matter</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Is she dead, though?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Absolutely</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: There Are Two Things Of Which I Have No
      Doubt</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: That You And I Are Going To Be Happy For
      The Rest Of Our Lives</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: And That We Are Never Ever Going To See
      Vriska Again</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Baby-Vriska wiggles her six talons. Kanaya
      cradles the little grub against her chest and pokes it in the nose.
      The grub reacts by blowing a bubble of bright cerulean yolk
      membrane out from between its lips. To her own surprise, the sight
      melts Rose’s heart in an instant. The emotion that hits her feels
      like one of her old visions. Suddenly she can see her and Kanaya’s
      future so clearly, like a map rolled out at her feet and stretching
      far into the horizon. Kanaya is right. Vriska is dead, and despite
      everything, she died a hero. Vriska was a complicated figure of
      contrasting extremes; her heroic actions were matched in scale only
      by her monstrous ones, and since no one had actually witnessed her
      end, it was impossible to say which side the pendulum swung and
      judged her death—Heroic or Just.</p>
      <p>It would be a fitting memorial for her and Kanaya to raise a
      version of Vriska who would be given every chance to make good on
      her noble characteristics. A true, symbolic redemption arc.
      Something about the thought appeals to Rose’s taste for the
      dramatic flourish. It would be proof that this was all worth it in
      the end: the destruction of multiple universes, the death of
      Kanaya’s friends, the circuitous rites of suffering experienced by
      the nearly infinite splintered versions of every being to inhabit
      Paradox Space...</p>
      <p>Rose loves her wife fiercely in this moment. The new Mother of
      her species, framed in a literal halo of light. She can’t contain
      her excitement. She leaps into the pit with Kanaya and runs to
      embrace her, not caring about the irreversible rainbow-colored
      stains that she’s smearing into her dress.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh Kanaya, you’re right.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: We are going to be so astonishingly
      happy!</p>
