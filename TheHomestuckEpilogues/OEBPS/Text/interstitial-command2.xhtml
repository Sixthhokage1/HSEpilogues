    <p>GR: or turn the page to read the appendices</p>
    <p>GR: adapting a nonlinear story to a file format that assumes linearity is a bit of a pain</p>
    <p>GR: chances are you already read that last line if you're here</p>
    <p>GR: unfortunately even though epub allows you to set the "<code>linear</code>" attribute to <code>"no"</code> for items listed in the spine of the book to mark it as auxiliary content, apparently most readers ignore that and display it in the linear flow of pages</p>
    <p>GR: so the link in this page's header just loops back to the regular prologue pages and doesn't do the strikethrough bit like the reprise of the prologue placed between meat and candy</p>
    <p>GR: anyway i've interjected enough</p>
