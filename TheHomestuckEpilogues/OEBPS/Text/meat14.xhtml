      <p class="no-indent"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">J</span>ake yawns
      and knocks on the window to Jane’s office again. For some reason
      Jane has the shades pulled shut all the way around, so he’s been
      hovering here for way too long in his best tie and his best pair of
      short-shorts. There’s a crowd gathered below, gaping at a rare
      in-person appearance of a globally famous butt. The sunset has
      turned the head offices of Crockercorp into a shimmering glass
      monolith—a beacon, if you will, of the future, visible for miles in
      every direction.</p>
      <p>Jane probably likes to think about it that way at least.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Jane, she pops her head out from between two strips
      of silk-lined venetian blind to glower at Jake, who is hovering
      uselessly in the air. <em>Use the front door</em>, she mouths at
      him. But he responds with his specialty: incomprehension.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Im sorry... what?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">The exasperated hand motions Jane tries next
      work better.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Oh! The front door, of course!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake flies down to the street so that he can
      take the front entrance. He whistles a quaint little ditty to
      himself while he waits for the elevator to go up to the top floor.
      This time he knocks on the office door, and Jane lets him in.</p>
      <p>Inside the office it’s dark and hazy. The whole place is
      candlelit, and Jane is reclining on her desk, sprawled out like a
      lounge singer on a grand piano. Specifically: a blue lounge singer,
      on a blue piano, just like in one of the hideous velvet paintings
      Jake bought in New Prospit a few years ago. Like all of his
      impulsive purchases, the tacky thing is gathering dust in a pile
      somewhere in one of the hundreds of spare rooms in his mansion,
      which now primarily functions as a very expensive warehouse for his
      atrocious hoarding habits.</p>
      <p>And intimate knowledge of his hoarding habits—particularly the
      type of sultry, cerulean content he is known to hoard—is
      <em>exactly</em> why Jane is wearing a blue dress with a very high
      hem. Jake’s bow tie practically spins at the sight of it. He
      freezes on the spot, an animal in the predatorial headlights of
      this buxom blue businesswoman.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Come have a glass of scotch with me Jake. We
      have so much to discuss.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I-indeed.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">He crosses the office and shakily accepts the
      offered glass of ludicrously expensive fermented barley grain. He
      raises it to his nose and pretends to sample the scent.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane i must say that is a very striking
      ensemble.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, you like it? Why don’t you...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Er, come take a closer look?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She’s really bad at this, she thinks. “This”
      being seduction. She’s so bad at it, in fact, that Jake immediately
      recognizes her ruse for what it is. Laughing nervously, he sucks
      the whole glass of scotch into his mouth in one go, ice cubes and
      all. And then, because he can’t actually stand the taste of scotch,
      immediately spits it back out, ice cubes and all, spraying Jane’s
      brand-new sexy dress with quite an ungentlemanly fountain of boozy
      spittle. Jane is lashed both by the scotch in her face and how
      quickly her plan has fallen apart.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Jake!</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Bejabbers!</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh no, all over my new dress...</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane i am so sorry. Here let me help you
      clean that giggle water off your kettle drums.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: No, no, you... you’ve done enough. Goodness,
      you’ve only been here two minutes and already... why did I ever
      think—</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane. Please i insist.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She tries to push him away, but Jake considers
      himself to be a gentleman. He helps her to the floor and shrugs off
      his dress coat so he can use it to wipe her down. She is staring at
      the ceiling like she hopes it will split open and suck her into a
      supermassive black hole so she doesn’t have to deal with anything
      that is going on right now. Some of Jake’s scotchy slobber is on
      her glasses, which is not the place she was planning on having it
      tonight.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Is this why you wanted to see me? To show off
      uh... this proper bit of frock?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, no, of course not. I just wanted
      to...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: To... talk about the economy.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: By jove the economy! Jane my dear friend
      please tell me all about the economy!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake doesn’t care about the economy. But he’s
      an ardent supporter of changing the subject.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Ah, it’s doing quite well right now
      actually.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I should hope so!</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: But it might not continue to do so in the
      future, which you can guess is of great concern to me, being that I
      am a pioneering entrepreneur.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Well frig, that’s awful and you should do
      everything in your power to adequately explain to me this conundrum
      which i admit i am not up to dick on.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: You...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane laughs quite sincerely as he ruffles his
      jacket through her hair.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, Jake, you really have no idea what’s
      going on, do you?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Wait is this...</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Is this about the election muckup? Because
      i—</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane puts a finger to Jake’s lip and shushes
      him. It’s a very smooth move. A total recovery. He shushes, and she
      directs him to one of the couches that line her office. They
      stumble there, his jacket and hands still wrapped around her
      shoulders.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: I’m sure you’ve had an earful about the
      election already.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I apologize. You must understand that my mind
      is quite occupied by it right now.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: But I’ve been doing an awful lot of thinking
      as of late.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I see. About what?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: About everything, I suppose.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: About my life, about all of our lives and the
      trajectory they’ve taken since we helped to create this new
      universe.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: You must admit that it’s a lot to grasp, and
      I’m not certain we’ve all taken the time to truly contemplate our
      place in it.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">This is not really the kind of conversation
      you initiate if you’re looking to extract a sexual deal out of
      someone. It is, however, the kind of conversation that you might
      have with a childhood friend who has become somewhat emotionally
      estranged from you. Both so busy with their exciting careers and
      misuse of their godhood. Who are they now? The same Jake and Jane
      who passed like particularly dysfunctional ships in the night a
      decade ago? Or is Jane wiser, and Jake kinder? Are they better
      versions of themselves? Jane absently rubs the narrow strap of her
      dress between two fingers, vainly attempting to sort out her
      jumbled thoughts.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: That’s an earful jane.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I know. It’s a head-full too.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I can’t help but worry...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Haven’t we really just been... drifting these
      last seven years?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Drifting, both in the sense of failing to
      fulfill our personal potentials,</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: And in the sense of... well, drifting
      apart?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane pulls a leg up beneath her, which slides
      her bare knee between Jake’s. The couch dips a bit under their
      weight.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I must admit i never thought of it that
      way.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I know.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: It’s just that... we’re both so busy all the
      time. The years go by so fast. And...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I miss you.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake blinks, his eyes wet and glossy beneath
      his spectacles.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Ah. Well... I suppose that i miss you too
      jane.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">The moment goes from calculated to genuine in
      an instant. Jake drops his coat and glides his hands down her bare
      arms so that he can... hold her? Yeah, that’s definitely what he’s
      doing. Holding her, and not too gently either.</p>
      <p>Jane really is quite pretty, with the candlelight glittering
      across her spectacles, her hair damp, and her front teeth poking
      out from beneath her lip. She’s so pretty that Jake can’t stop
      himself from sliding a hand up to her neck and using his thumb to
      tip her face back so that they’re staring right at each other in
      the low light, close enough that Jane can probably smell his
      disgusting scotch breath. She definitely does smell it, because her
      cute nose scrunches up and she laughs again, a very small, private
      noise. A noise just for him.</p>
      <p>So he kisses her. Very well, if he does think so himself. Dirk
      has given him a lot of uninvited but incisive criticism on his
      kissing over the years, so Jake wouldn’t be surprised if he was
      considered the best kisser on the entire planet at this point. Jane
      breathes in, shocked for a moment. Even more shocked when Jake
      hooks a hand around her waist and pushes her down. She makes a
      startled noise into his mouth. Then she throws her arms around his
      neck. It should be awkward, taboo at this point, considering the
      history between them. But it all happens so easily. Jane undoing
      Jake’s bow tie, Jake hooking his thumb under the hem of her dress
      and hiking it up another inch it really cannot spare for decency’s
      sake.</p>
      <p>There is nothing awkward about this moment, Jake thinks. Two old
      friends, hot as the blazes, giving in to passion? Who could accuse
      them of impropriety? Nobody worth their salt, in his book. It all
      makes perfect sense. The inevitable consummation of a whirlwind
      romance fit for the big screen.</p>
      <p>Really, the only surprise is how long it took to happen. Jane is
      a beautiful lady, that’s for sure. She always has been, but she’s
      only grown more ravishing as she’s come into the full blossom of
      her womanhood. Smooth, silky skin... thick, dark lashes... full,
      feminine lips... not to mention curves like the dickens. It’s all
      certainly conducive to activities of close phonological proximity
      to the phrase.</p>
      <p>Jane’s baby-soft palm, unmarred by the calluses of deft
      swordsmanship, slides down Jake’s cheek and dips under the collar
      of his shirt. She caresses his clavicle and then tenderly trails
      her fingers up the side of his neck, steadying herself as she
      deepens their passionate kiss. Jane’s touch is nothing like Dirk’s.
      Dirk has palms so rough that they sting, especially on skin that’s
      thin and supple. Like the column of the throat, right over the
      jugular.</p>
      <p>He pulls away from Jane’s lips and lifts her spectacles off her
      nose. It’s a motion that still feels practiced and familiar,
      despite how long ago he’d last had the precious chance. Those rare,
      intimate moments that Jake was allowed to slip off Dirk’s shades
      and look upon his face, unobstructed, stand out more clearly in his
      mind than almost any other in his life.</p>
      <p>Jake swallows. He can’t stop thinking about how Dirk kissed him
      last time they “didn’t hook up.” Which is a thing, of course, that
      “didn’t happen,” so how can Jake possibly be thinking about it?</p>
      <p>Is it just some sort of Pavlovian response that’s making his
      heart race like this? He does his best to push the untimely
      thoughts away, but his fingers tremble as he sets Jane’s glasses
      aside.</p>
      <p>Jane gazes back at him, cheeks flushed with desire, eyes dark
      and alluringly coy. All her features are round and soft. Welcoming,
      soothing. The kind of face that makes you feel like you’ve come
      home. Dirk is the exact opposite. Long nose, thick eyebrows,
      pointed features. A man who seems built down to the very essence of
      his soul to be sharp, hard to approach, harder still to touch. But
      when looked at from the right angle, he’s anime levels of handsome.
      Breathtakingly, choir-of-angels singingly, anime-handsome—the sort
      of man you can’t keep your hands off of, no matter how jagged his
      edges. But his hair is so much softer than it looks. His heart too.
      When a heart like that opens up to you, it opens up the whole world
      as well. A world of increased appreciation for combat, philosophy,
      life, love...</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Yelp!!!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake yelps and rolls off the couch in such a
      panic that he almost takes Jane with him. She flies to her feet,
      startled, breathing fast, and readjusts her disheveled clothes.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Jake?</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake’s already hovering two feet off the
      ground before Jane can say another word. He doubles back to the end
      of the office and grabs the bottle of near-untouched scotch before
      kicking open the latch to one of Jane’s giant windows and letting
      himself out.</p>
      <p>He’s got a lot of things to think about, apparently.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: What the...</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Everliving <em>fuck!</em></p>

      <p class="no-indent">Jane stands alone in her office, confused,
      horny, and kind of pissed. She slowly slips the strap of her dress
      back over her shoulder. Then she closes the window, sits in her CEO
      chair and speed-dials the number for her one-man Kitchen
      Cabinet.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yo, what up?</p>

      huh?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: How much of that scotch did you have?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: I think a few drops made it into my mouth,
      when Jake spewed his beverage directly onto my face.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Things went that badly, huh?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Augh!</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: This is so embarrassing.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: You know, I wouldn’t have approached it this
      way if I wasn’t absolutely certain its margin for error was
      virtually nonexistent.</p>

      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Were you nice to him?</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Well, I...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I told you, you can’t be nice to Jake.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: ...</p>

      right now.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Why don’t you leave Jake to me?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jane squeezes her eyes shut and, very softly
      and quietly, bumps her head against the edge of her desk.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Why do I feel as if we’ve had this exact
      conversation, almost word for word, before?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Because we have. Many times.</p>
      <p class="jane">JANE: Well, what do we do now? I’m afraid I’ve gone

      <p class="no-indent">Jane, head still planted firmly on desk,
      laughs at that. There’s a sardonic twist in Dirk’s voice that
      intentionally recalls every time he’s ever fucked up. But it
      satisfies Jane nevertheless. She knows that he won’t fail her.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jane">JANE: Fine. Please call me later so that we may
      strategize.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Dirk doesn’t wait. There’s a shadow cast in
      his doorway that is much more important than the election. Rose is
      braced against the doorframe, one hand on her purse and the other
      on her waist. She has her head tipped just so, her pale hair
      falling across in her face at an angle that bisects her perfectly
      neutral expression. Dirk sets down his phone and acknowledges her
      with a nod.</p>
