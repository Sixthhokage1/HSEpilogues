      <p class="Command">&gt; John: Fight Lord English.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">All around you is pandemonium, a
      multichromatic cyclone of shrieks and clashing colors, as Meenah’s
      ghost army claws at the borders of Paradox Space. Wait, that
      <em>is</em> her army, right? It seems like it’s been so long since
      you’ve thought about any of this. But you’re pretty sure this is
      the army you, Meenah, Vriska, and the other Serket were trying to
      raise. So it’s true, then. The juju has finally unloaded you,
      exactly where you needed to be.</p>
      <p>Every screaming body pitches down and goes white the closer it
      gets to the black hole above you. And below, front and center, is
      Lord English himself: the big deal version, pimped up, hulked out,
      and throwing a huge, universe-ending tantrum. Unlike his younger
      form, his eyes aren’t flickering wildly. They’re locked in place,
      an eight ball in each socket. You briefly wonder what that means,
      but your curiosity is interrupted by a massive outburst of
      technicolor dragon breath coming from his mouth. The laser show
      tears its way through a squadron of ghosts led by... is that...
      <em>Tavros?</em></p>
      <p>Seems like an awful choice to lead an army, but what do you
      know. Wasn’t Vriska supposed to be leading the charge? Where is
      she, anyway?</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Listen.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">You don’t have time to dwell on Vriska. She’s
      probably somewhere around here, biding her time, waiting to execute
      her masterstroke and finish English off at just the right moment,
      like the cunning bitch she is. No, you can’t think about that now.
      You’re becoming enraptured by the sound surrounding you. Not a
      sound... a sensation. A subharmonic symphony that you can only hear
      in your bones. This is it: the end of Paradox Space. The thing you
      saw in your anime dreams. A hard lump of air travels down your
      throat but you—</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Don’t hesitate!</p>
      <p class="no-indent">Behind you the juju disappears, sucked out of
      reality with a <em>POP</em>. You move your arms in a dumb little
      motion, sort of like jazz hands, and summon up a wisp of wind to
      keep your cracked glasses in place. You then pull one of your
      sickest hammers out of your strife deck. Your teen friends follow
      suit. You cast a glance back over your shoulder at them. They all
      look pretty cool. Rose knitting light around her with the Quills of
      Echidna, Dave with his sword Caledfwlch at the ready, trailing time
      distortions behind him that look, if you don’t squint, a lot like
      JPEG artifacts. Jade’s got her favorite gun cocked and ready, with
      her ears perked up.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jade">JADE: lets DO this!!!!</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t get overconfident.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: We have to do it exactly like we discussed.
      First...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">But Rose doesn’t get to finish what she was
      trying to say. Lord English’s mouth roars open and a wave of energy
      blasts through your group. Rose is the only one caught in it. She
      dissolves in slow motion. You can see the outline of her body in
      shadow. One arm thrown up over her eyes, shoulders pulled up
      defensively, cape billowing out behind her. She leaves an
      afterimage of shimmering light in her wake and then dissipates,
      drifting apart like a handful of salt tossed out to sea. You can
      almost hear the cosmic clock counting down, tick tock, and a chime
      to accompany her fate: <em>Heroic</em>.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jade">JADE: rose!!!! no!!!!!!!!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jade doesn’t wait to fire. Space splinters
      open around her so loudly it drowns out the fire from her rifle.
      Lord English raises one of his giant, fuck-off hands to deflect her
      anomaly-powered bullets, giving Dave an opportunity to attack. Dave
      raises his legendary blade and aims for the impressively beefy
      torso. It should be a sure hit, like slashing the side of an
      unusually broad, green barn. But he whiffs completely. It’s a
      wonder how such a big man can move so <em>fast</em>.</p>
      <p>Jade inspects her rifle, and tosses it aside. What is she
      <em>doing</em>? With all the powers of a Witch of Space at her
      command, combined with the infinite abilities of a First Guardian,
      she’s still messing around with basic firearms? She makes two tight
      fists and strikes a pose befitting of a warrior about to <em>power
      the fuck up</em>. She focuses, and strains. A doggy snarl rips its
      way through her clenched teeth. A hazy aura envelops her, as space
      buckles and lenses about her form. And then...</p>
      <p>Nothing. No crackle of electricity. No licks of chartreuse
      flame. She searches within, realizes her power source is completely
      unavailable to her. Then she looks up, and it dawns on her. That
      thing in the sky, the hungry black orb gobbling up everything in
      sight... <em>that’s where the green sun used to be</em>. It’s been
      swallowed completely by a black hole. The realization is
      horrifying. She feels suddenly, absolutely helpless.</p>
      <p>Jade opens her mouth to scream for help, but she’s cut off. A
      razor-sharp fragment of reality slams into her back. It skewers
      her, exiting right through the center of the space symbol on her
      hoodie. She chokes and goes limp, encircled by a halo of her own
      blood.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Get in there!</p>
      <p class="no-indent">You’re barely a minute into the battle and
      both your tactician and your most powerful player are down. You
      summon a windstorm to momentarily keep Lord English preoccupied,
      and try to grab your sister’s wrist. Instead, you catch her by the
      hem of her skirt. Lord English struggles to emerge from the
      wind-prison you just whipped up. You can see one of his arms
      flailing just outside the circumference of your storm. Tavros has
      pulled himself to his feet and, recognizing English’s temporary
      state of vulnerability, directs the ghosts on his side to attack.
      No one is paying attention to him.</p>
      <p>Jade is floating away from you. You’re having a hard time
      maintaining your whirlwind, your glasses, your hammer, and your
      grip on her. Lord English’s head has emerged from the apex of your
      storm. He looks directly at you, and his mighty jaw creaks open
      slowly, well beyond the reasonable capacity of any mortal mandible
      hinge. You stare directly down the dark barrel of his throat, which
      readies another terrible laser shot. There’s not much time to
      react.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Make a decision.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">You let Jade go. She floats in literal slow
      motion, buoyed by the billows of her skirt. You summon a gust of
      wind and push her farther away from the battle. You’re hit by a
      blowback from the current, and a line of her blood splashes across
      your face. But releasing her has created enough separation, just as
      you hoped. The laser breath passes between you, narrowly missing
      you both.</p>
      <p>You reel back like you’ve just been punched. Your control over
      the storm goes haywire for a second, long enough for Lord English
      to free his gaudy gold peg leg from it and, more catastrophically,
      for you to drop your already broken glasses. You whirl around and
      swing your hammer to bop his horrible, deadly skull back into your
      storm. You can’t really see what’s going on, but you hear a
      gigantic CRUNCH. And then another. And another. It sounds like a
      cereal commercial is playing outside the periphery of your
      vision.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: dave!</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: what</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: is lord english... eating my hammer?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah dude he totally is</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: what the FUCK.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">It’s a true outrage. This isn’t going to work,
      waging battle without your glasses. Lord English has just eaten one
      of your sickest hammers due to your blind folly.</p>
      <p>You take a deep breath and dive down, right into the sea of
      ghosts. You land clumsily, palms first, and do an accidental
      handspring right into a bunch of alternate timeline trolls you
      don’t recognize.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: uh, hey guys. anyone see a pair of glasses
      down here? it’s pretty important.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Everybody shrugs. This gaggle of lost souls
      collectively personifies uselessness. It is inconceivable to you
      that a single one of them will survive this battle. Perhaps it’s
      for the best.</p>
      <p>Behind you, the wind barrier tears open. Lord English explodes
      from his confinement and swings his peg leg through the army.
      Ghosts scatter like bowling pins, many flying into the cracks in
      space. Before the leg hits you, a troll leaps into action and
      blocks the blow. Her trident makes a satisfying ring off the round
      of the peg and sends it skidding backward.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: woah, that was a close one!</p>
      <p class="feferi">MEENAH: shell of time to finally show up</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: sorry, we were kinda busy!</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: er, bit of a weird question but...</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: have you seen a pair of glasses down
      here?</p>
      <p class="tavros">TAVROS: uH, aRE THESE WHAT YOU’RE LOOKING
      FOR?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Tavros appears behind you and hands over your
      glasses, still in two pieces. You return them to your face so you
      can take a quick assessment of the battlefield.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Take a quick assessment of the
      battlefield.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">Oh boy. Lord English, now free from your
      wind-trap, is stomping around, throwing an even bigger shitfit than
      before. The black hole above him is getting bigger. You can see the
      ghosts at the edge of the battlefield tumbling through space toward
      it: distorted, screaming, and helpless.</p>
      <p>Also, Tavros suddenly is leading an admirable charge of about
      six ghosts to attack Lord English’s flesh foot. You wince, because
      you can see what’s coming before it happens. It’s a shame, because
      you didn’t have the chance to thank him for finding your glasses.
      English raises his knee and stomps three ghosts into oblivion. The
      other four, Tavros included, get vaporized in a beam. The ghost
      army seems to be thinning out pretty badly by now. Most of the ones
      remaining are either fleeing or getting sucked into the hole.</p>
      <p>You whip out another hammer. A classic this time, the
      Wrinklefucker. Its boinging pair of irons are hot, hissing, and
      ready for action. You use the wind to propel yourself back toward
      the fray. Dave is slicing papercuts into English’s torso with
      glancing nicks from his blade, but the monster is spry as ever,
      making him a difficult target. You take advantage of his distracted
      cavorting to whack him on the side of the skull. Your hammer
      connects with a satisfying <em>crunch</em>, and he stumbles back,
      but recovers and lunges forward in a motion so quick you can barely
      follow it.</p>
      <p>English grabs the Wrinklefucker with his mouth. You hold on
      tight, but he starts shaking his head rapidly the way a dog with a
      rabbit tries to break its neck. He chomps down hard and shatters
      the hammer’s head, gobbling down the broken pieces. You watch
      incredulously as the giant dude eats yet another one of your
      favorite hammers. Unbelievable. He lunges for the handle in a
      ridiculously greedy attempt to finish what’s left of your weapon.
      You recoil, careening out toward the black hole, but manage to
      stabilize yourself. You look at the handle of your tragically
      masticated Wrinklefucker, shrug, and toss it into the hole.</p>
      <p>Glancing back down toward your foe, you notice Meenah still
      appears to be hanging on, clinging to his left suspender.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="feferi">MEENAH: yo hold on</p>
      <p class="feferi">MEENAH: goin in for the krill</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dave takes a step back to provide some space
      for whatever killer move she’s got up her sleeve. She raises her
      trident and jams it into the back of Lord English’s neck. English
      reacts as if he’s been stung by a bee. He howls and rears up,
      throwing Meenah off his back with a force that sends her hurtling
      out into space. You can’t track her into the void with your eyes,
      she’s flung so far and so fast. You can only assume the worst.</p>
      <p>Glancing back down, you see English hasn’t wasted any time after
      ridding himself of the irksome Heiress. He has Dave pinned under
      his big green foot and is applying pressure. You’ve got to act
      fast. You flip out another hammer—you don’t care which one—and send
      it flying toward the monster’s face. English quickly whips his head
      in the direction of the sailing hammer, and swallows it whole. You
      rush after it, reaching for another hammer without thinking. The
      brief distraction, aside from providing English with another tasty
      hammer-snack, seems to have bought Dave just enough wiggle room to
      slip out from under the foot, regain his composure, and draw his
      sword.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: john i need a little...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dave ducks a wide blow from English’s swinging
      fist. He backs up nervously, holding his sword out in front of him
      with two shaking hands.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: anything</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i need a little anything right now</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: literally any stupid fucking thing you can
      do</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: i’m on it!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">You pop your strife deck open and just spam
      the hell out of your remaining hammers. A few excellent hammers
      that cost you a fortune to make, a bunch of shitty hammers you made
      as a joke, and everything in between. With another flick of your
      wrist you spin them around you so fast they form a perfectly
      impenetrable barrier of pure Shitty Hammer. Okay, the barrier’s
      probably not the slightest bit impenetrable, but you’ve gotta psych
      yourself up for this next attack somehow. In your hands is a weapon
      you haven’t thought about in a long time: the Pop-a-matic
      Vrillyhoo. It hums with both tricksy energy and the barely
      contained potential for mischief. You strike the baddest-ass pose
      possible to strike while wielding such a clownish-looking
      implement, and begin your advance.</p>
      <p>However, you’re interrupted by a voice screaming out from behind
      you. It’s half familiar, half... cat?</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">You whip your head around just in time to see
      a bolt of orange-and-green energy racing by you like a bullet. It
      slams into Lord English and sends him stumbling.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Dave stands there with his sword, absolutely
      agog, his expression perfectly reflecting a blend of horror and the
      total inability to process who or what he is looking at.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      <p class="dave">DAVE: well that sounds fucked up but ok</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Davepeta spreads their wings, sending waves of
      warm light through the battlefield. The light feels comforting,
      somehow, when it hits you. Behind them, Lord English is struggling
      to his feet again, roaring as he rolls from one side to the other
      like a kicked-over turtle. His muscles are so huge it’s hard for
      him to maneuver.</p>
      <p>It would be hilarious, if only all of reality weren’t tearing
      apart at the seams around you. The sky shivers and shakes, raining
      needles of breached matter that burst and shatter at all angles,
      opening new voids where they land. Above the bedlam, Davepeta is
      finishing up an inspiring speech. You realize you tuned most of it
      out due to the surrounding chaos.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="davepetasprite">DAVEPETASPRITE^2: B33 &lt; <span class="davepetasprite-dialogue">i know it looks pawful right now but we can do it</span></p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Well, that last bit was pretty good, you
      guess. At least you caught the end, which was presumably the most
      important and uplifting part. You and Dave exchange a look that
      silently says all that needs to be said right now. Davepeta is
      right. You three are the only ones left, and there’s no room for
      failure.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Final Round.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">The last leg of the fight proceeds like a
      well-oiled machine. Perhaps a well-oiled machine careening down a
      steep hill toward the edge of a cliff, but well-oiled nonetheless.
      You, Dave, and Davepeta: that’s what you call a <em>team</em>. And
      not just because, upon examining your surroundings, you three
      appear to be the last three living or dead beings left in
      existence. But dammit, you’ll <em>take</em> it. You turn your
      hammers into an efficient spiral, a carousel of ass-kicking, and
      direct its fury right at Lord English’s face. The butts of the
      hammers hit him over and over again, like racking up points in a
      slot machine.</p>
      <p>Dave manages to carve a red line up Lord English’s side, drawing
      real blood this time. The slash snaps one of his suspenders in
      half, and must sever something else too, because the sword makes a
      gristly, meaty squelch when he pulls it out. Dave turns a half
      second too late to avoid getting sprayed by the wound.</p>
      <p>English howls and swipes at Dave. Not wasting any time, you bury
      a hammer in his gaping mouth. Unsurprisingly, it gets swallowed, so
      you throw another one. Now you’re just throwing them into his
      fucking mouth like you’re feeding him Scooby Snacks. It’s a
      gluttonous display you won’t soon forget. You realize you seem to
      be stuck in a cycle and are in serious danger of running out of
      hammers.</p>

      Lord English’s back, and then kicks him in the back of the head.
      You time it perfectly and complete the combo with a well-placed

      your full inventory of hammers like an all-you-can-eat buffet, but
      the bullshit stops HERE, you think. Which is why you refuse to let
      the handle go when English wraps his tongue around it and unhinges
      his jaw with a sick, wet pop. You plant one foot under his nose and
      the other on his mandible and tug back. He makes a guttural sound
      at the back of his throat and sucks the Vrillyhoo deeper in. Your
      heel slips on some drool, and your whole leg skids straight into
      his mouth.</p>
      <p>You twist, off balance, and fail to catch yourself. You only let
      go of the hammer when you feel the walls of his throat constrict
      around your ankles. The pressure sucks you in up to the knees with
      one gulp. Vrillyhoo is in his stomach, and you’re following it down
      quicker than you can even process. Is this the end? No, you think.
      This is such an unfairly <em>stupid</em> fucking way to die!</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Davepeta flashes behind you and hooks their
      arms under your shoulders. They yank you out, clearing your head
      from the monster’s maw at least. But English rehinges his jaw and
      clamps down on your chest. <em>Hard</em>.</p>
      <p>Davepeta reacts quickly, shoving their claws between his molars.
      You can hear them growling as they slowly twist their arm to pry
      the massive jaw open.</p>
      <p>You’re not dead yet, but Lord English definitely got a big,
      sharp tooth in you. Your vision reels and goes blurry, then patchy,
      then dark, then—</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Don’t fucking die.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">You pass out for... well, you have no idea how
      long it was. But it was long enough for Davepeta to get you out of
      Lord English’s mouth. You can see their face floating above you.
      They’re just a smudge of neon swimming in a sea of chaos.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">Davepeta holds something up to your face: your
      glasses. They tuck them into the front pocket of your hoodie and
      pat you on the head before darting through the air back towards the
      battle.</p>
      <p>You’re woozy and don’t have the energy to stop yourself from
      drifting. There’s blood floating up around you, dilute and bubbly
      in the air like cooking oil in water. It’s yours.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Examine wound.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">You lift your chin and see it: Lord English’s
      gold tooth cracked off at the base and embedded in your chest. It
      must be stuck between two of your ribs, you think, because it hurts
      like a bitch when you try to breathe. You keep your head up and
      watch the battle, but it’s all so indistinct and far away, playing
      out like shadow theater on a wall.</p>
      <p>Dave finds his moment. He rams Caledfwlch into Lord English’s
      chest, all the way up to the hilt. It penetrates his flesh like
      nothing else has to this point. The wound around the blade sizzles
      slightly. The weapon—the unusual material it’s made out of—is
      poison to English. He cries out in a cracked, broken staccato. It’s
      an earsplitting wail that cleaves the last of the Furthest Ring
      apart. Reality falls away from the mooring of the all-surrounding
      white light like a peeled eggshell.</p>
      <p>Dave’s trying to get his sword free but he’s stuck. English’s
      shriek morphs into a sinister, predatory rattle as his jaw creaks
      open. His mouth envelops Dave’s head and snaps shut. He twists
      once, then twice, then again with a <em>CRACK</em>. A disaster of
      blood instantly coats his skull and upper torso. He swallows the
      disembodied head whole with a triumphant gulp. The limp torso goes
      spiraling lazily in the direction of the black hole.</p>
      <p>Davepeta is yelling something indistinct. Or maybe they’re just
      yowling at the top of their lungs. That’s what you feel like doing
      right now, but you can’t move. Your limbs feel like lead. You
      consult your strife deck, but you’ve got nothing left. No hammers,
      no nothing. It’s up to Davepeta, who appears to have plenty left.
      If not in the strife deck per se, then in the <em>heart</em>.</p>
      <p>During the beast’s grisly moment of gloating over the younger
      Strider’s death, Davepeta stands twenty paces behind him, crouches
      low to the ground, wiggles their behind, and pounces. They cling to
      English’s back, wrap their legs around his midriff, draw back their
      arms, and plunge their claws deep into the behemoth’s armpits.
      Their gloved hands end up knuckle-deep in the upper serratus
      muscles on either side. Davepeta then spreads their wings in an
      awe-inspiring display. An unwitting spectator viewing Lord English
      from the front might suspect the garish orange-green wings belonged
      to English himself.</p>
      <p>Davepeta then, with all their might, lifts Lord English into the
      air and flies toward the black hole, trailing ribbons of blood and
      neon. English resists fiercely, but they’re both already locked
      into the gravity well, beyond any threshold of escape. He cannot do
      anything about it, no matter how much he screams and cries. This
      victory, this final sacrifice, has always been the destiny of
      Davepeta, as they have sensed from the moment they were created.
      And to die on this day, in this way, has always been the destiny of
      Lord English.</p>
      <p>The black hole—the gaping, implacable, cosmic embodiment of the
      dead cherub, his long-departed sister—finally welcomes Lord English
      home.</p>
      <p>English and Davepeta are sucked in with a subatomic whimper. The
      reunion sends shock waves across the pitiful remains of Paradox
      Space. And then everything is wholly, utterly, and categorically
      <em>silent.</em> It’s over. Lord English is dead.</p>
      <p>But it doesn’t feel over, somehow. You don’t feel like you’ve
      won. You can barely feel anything, actually. All you can think
      about, for now, is...</p>
      <p>Davepeta. How they were so unfettered and brave. How they
      sacrificed themselves by flying right into the black hole
      like...</p>
      <p><em>Like a fucking piece of garbage</em>, you can almost hear
      Dave saying. May God rest his soul.</p>
      <p>You collapse against whatever is passing for the floor at this
      moment of utterly null corporeal conditions surrounding you. It
      doesn’t feel possible. You’re not sure you can even trust your
      perception well enough to believe it. But it seems to be over.
      You’ve convinced yourself of this truth well enough to allow
      yourself to exhale. Enough to allow yourself to suddenly
      acknowledge the agony coursing through your body, emanating from
      the gold tooth lodged in your chest. Enough to allow yourself to
      succumb to the overwhelming urge to sleep.</p>
