      <p class="rose">ROSE: When I was a child, I wrote a novel.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose is speaking with her eyes closed. She is
      weary, but standing for now, near one of Dirk’s work tables. She
      has both hands resting on the chassis of his recent project,
      Sawtooth 3.1. The energy humming inside its mechanical heart warms
      her palms. Dirk snorts, but in a good-natured sort of way. That’s
      the closest he usually gets to laughing.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Another one of those Lalonde childhood wizard
      fics, I presume?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">He leans his elbow on the table and stares at
      her over the rims of his shades. The weight of Dirk’s scrutiny is
      potent. She looks away.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Complacency of the Learned.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Ah. <em>The</em> wizard fic, then.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course, it was nothing like the polished
      masterpiece penned by the middle-aged version of myself from your
      world.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Nor did the saga span as many volumes.
      Thirteen-year-old Rose only managed to draft the one, it shames me
      to say.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: How pathetic.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I know.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose steps back, trailing her fingers over the
      rivets that line Sawtooth 3.1’s chest. Eyes closed again, she
      passes in front of the window. With the sunset behind her she’s a
      shadow ringed in yellow light that turns white at the tips of her
      hair.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Though I must say, in defense of Young Rose’s
      literary integrity,</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Having carefully studied all volumes of the
      elder’s work, and then revisiting my youthful preteen scribbles of
      passion...</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I observed more power and emotion in the
      single ragged notebook than the full span of the bestselling
      series.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s more raw. It betrays considerably more
      sincerity than my young self was surely ever aware of stitching
      into the prose.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It <em>meant</em> something.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hmm.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She turns to look at him.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: For all its plainly evident amateurism as the
      literary product of a child, I’ve come to believe it’s a much
      stronger work standing alone as a single volume, its meaning and
      symbolism potently compressed, and its message shining through more
      nakedly, undisguised by the cleverness of a more seasoned
      writer.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But the basics are the same as the series
      you’ve read. The plot concerns the machinations of twelve wizard
      children.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: They revolt against the complacency of the
      wise, kind wizards, and go on to become responsible for great
      evils.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It isn’t their intent to commit atrocities,
      or within their nature to do so originally. They become corrupted
      by an overabundance of knowledge. The kind never meant for the
      mortal mind to grasp.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, this sounds pretty close to my
      recollection of it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It certainly wasn’t the most fucked up thing
      I’ve ever written.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But it was the most... psychologically
      potent? The most personal, easily.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But the personal aspects to it were all
      telegraphed through allegory and esoteric symbolism.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I wrote it in what would be best described as
      a fevered haze, as if I were pulling inspiration from beyond
      myself—channeling the story, rather than writing it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: You could almost call the process...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She runs a hand through her hair, fanning it
      into a halo that is suspended in the air for a moment, trailing
      spiderwebs of gold that dissolve into dust. She’s smirking now,
      just a little.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: ...en<em>light</em>ened.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: That sucked.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It also sounds like it’s the opposite of what
      was going on?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sounds more like you were trapped in a sort
      of dire creative fugue state causing you to chart your own mental
      profile using metaphor revolving around murderous, omniscient
      children.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Well, consider the playful pun rescinded.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Apologies for diminishing your presence with
      my suboptimal health and the toll it has taken on my wordplay.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Thanks. It’s been very difficult for me.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ve been a real trouper.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Anyway, my point is that I’ve long suspected
      my story was a pre-manifestation of my Seer of Light powers. I was
      seeing beyond my universe into another.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: My original thesis was that the children
      represented the twelve trolls who created our universe.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But over the years, I have come to see how
      malleable any apparent fact of numerological significance can
      be.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Adaptable, actually. Adaptable to shifting
      circumstance. Changes in setting, stakes, and allied ensembles.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Twelve. That’s how many players went through
      the door at the end of our game.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Exactly.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: My friends and yours, as well as Kanaya,
      Karkat, Terezi, and Calliope.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dirk settles in against the wall beside Rose,
      shoulder to shoulder. She seems to take some measure of comfort in
      the physical proximity. When she finds herself leaning against
      him—probably without thinking about it, Dirk imagines, because
      neither of them really “do” that—he doesn’t pull away. If it’s her,
      it’s all right. He won’t begrudge her a small weakness now.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You describe this as a fact of numerological
      significance.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Which makes it seem you suspect these
      correlations are something less than utterly providential. As if
      there is a part of you holding on to the belief that certain
      figures are coincidental. That their significance and repetition
      smacks of bullshit.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Do they not smack of bullshit?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: They smack of a bunch of things, and a bunch
      of other things also happen to smack of bullshit. But the network
      of relations isn’t perfectly traceable, nor can they all be mapped
      on a one-to-one basis. It’s unclear exactly which things are
      smacking, just as it’s unclear that when it comes to bullshit,
      whether or not smacking accurately describes what is being done per
      se.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose looks up to Dirk with the ghost of a
      smile that she inherited from him. On her face, its blankness is as
      enigmatic as the Mona Lisa’s.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Could it be that it is <em>you</em> who is
      smacking of bullshit, dear father?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Nah, I smack of many admirable qualities, as
      well as keen insights.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She doesn’t seem to have another riposte to
      return, but her gaze lingers. She stares into his shades as if
      convinced she could see past them. Dirk allows their eyes to
      meet.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m just saying it’s all evidence of a grand
      design. An immortal, metatextual apparatus beyond our ken that we
      can only catch glimpses of when we’re proverbially shitting our
      brains out through our nose.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Which both you and I know.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Which <em>only</em> you and I know,
      apparently.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Which is precisely my question.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Her gaze drifts towards the ceiling.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: In my story, all twelve of the disciples fell
      victim to the vagaries of power.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: They were filled with the light of knowledge
      and one by one they succumbed to it, turning insane or evil or,
      most often, both.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: If this is the effect unchecked powers have
      on players living in a post-canon victory state, then why isn’t it
      affecting any of our other friends?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Well.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I got a few theories.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She shoots him a <span class="Standard-Text CharOverride-14">look.</span></p>
      <p>It’s the kind of look Kanaya gives her sometimes.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Only a few?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I mean, some of us have stopped using our
      powers completely. Not a whole lot of need for emergency
      resurrections or complex timeline manipulation on a planet that’s
      never had a conflict more serious than a sportsball riot or a
      rumpled hat shortage.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But even aside from how often they’re
      used...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Some powers don’t lend themselves to the
      infinite expansion of one’s mind, the way ours do.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: So what you’re saying is, it’s more a matter
      of one’s aspect than it is whether one’s powers are practiced
      further, or allowed to atrophy.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yep.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: In that case...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose sways suddenly.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: In that case, perhaps Terezi had the right
      idea.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Getting away from this place, I mean.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Maybe I was a fool for imagining I could
      settle down here.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She jerks away from the wall in a tortured,
      rag-doll motion, one hand snapping out vainly for something to
      brace herself against. She staggers forward a bit.</p>
      <p>Dirk doesn’t reach out to steady her. Anyone else might have had
      the empathetic reflex to do so. Maybe it says something about him
      that he lacks this reflex. And maybe it says something about Rose
      that she prefers it this way. Try as she might to convince herself
      otherwise, through marriage vows and occasional banter about
      adoption with her wife, she is still a solitary creature. She
      gasps, sucks breath down her throat, and squeezes her eyes shut so
      hard that a tear rolls out. She slides back down the wall, sitting
      on the floor to save her energy. She’s mostly composed when she
      raises her head. There’s bitter laughter at the edge of her
      words.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: How... How are you handling this so well?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I assumed it was just that feigned Strider
      Stoicism, but you seem to be taking this...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: In stride?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Ugh.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I won’t lie, it’s definitely making me feel
      pretty crazy.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dirk stands over her, adjusts his hair,
      crosses his arms. He makes no motion to bother joining her on the
      floor. He looks very together. He says the word “crazy” with the
      same intonation with which he might say “good morning.” It’s hard
      to believe he means it at all.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But I’ve got more practice at this than you
      do. I spent most of my life before the game multitasking my entire
      fucking subconscious. I’ve had several times my age on paper to
      contemplate these mysteries.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Years of prying open can after can of worms
      filled with answers I don’t like.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Cut yourself on the edge more than once and
      you stop getting surprised by all the blood.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose wraps her hands around her upper arms
      like there’s a winter chill rattling through the workshop. She
      shivers.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s not the headaches that concern me
      most.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: In fact, I don’t think it’s the expansion of
      my powers that is causing the headaches, but rather my own
      resistance to it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Sometimes I get this feeling that I could, if
      I really wanted to, just let go.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It would be as easy as opening my eyes.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s like that feeling you get when you’re
      far enough out of a dream to be conscious of it, but not yet
      awake.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m caught in the liminal space between
      reality and reverie, where people once believed demons dwelled. But
      the only reason the demon is still sitting on my chest is because I
      refuse to banish it. All it would take is looking directly at
      it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m forcing myself to stumble through my life
      as a sleepwalker. All this pain and sorrow could go away if I would
      just allow myself to wake up.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then why don’t you?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Because I’m not sure that the person opening
      her eyes will be me.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Her voice is lost at sea, swallowed by the
      swell of darkness lurking in her imagination.</p>
      <p>This time, Dirk does reach out to steady her. He kneels in front
      of her, curls a knuckle under her chin, and lifts her face up to
      his level. Then, in a deliberate motion, he pulls off his
      shades.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I understand completely.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose’s eyelids flutter, heavy. She meets the
      intensity of his naked gaze aloofly, like she’s not aware this is
      the first time he’s ever let her see it.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Hm?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I know I sound pretty nonchalant most of the
      time, but actually I’m scared shitless of myself.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ve always had this uncanny ability to chart
      a course from A to Z and not give a fuck about any of the letters
      in between.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m not sure anyone should be allowed to have
      that much foresight. Especially a guy like me.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: What upsets me most, I think, is the distance
      this is all putting between me and everyone I know.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: The farther above the board you fly, the
      harder it gets to care about the pieces.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I hear you. And personally speaking, things
      usually work out for the best when all of those pieces do exactly
      what I say.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: So I’m also probably not the kind of guy who
      should get to be right all the time.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose laughs softly. She’s not scared of this
      abyss she’s staring into at all. She doesn’t even think to look
      away.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s really not an inch of humility in
      you, is there.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ve just spent a lot of time in my own
      head.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Maybe absolute self-absorption is the
      inevitable outcome, when the self is all you’ve ever known. When
      you’re <em>drowning</em> in it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I know there’s plenty of things that suck
      about me. No point feigning humility about the things that
      don’t.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: And yes, I may be a shitty human being,
      but,</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: As a mechanic, I’m off the fucking
      charts.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Rose’s eyes have grown distant, almost
      mirrorlike. Dirk can see himself reflected in her vacant stare.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: All the pieces in their place.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: The mechanisms all running smoothly.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">She says this in a hollow tone. It’s the
      disarming voice a puppeteer ventriloquizes for a marionette. Her
      head falls toward her shoulder slowly. Dirk catches her cheek as
      she slides into sleep. It’s difficult for the untrained ear to spot
      the exact moment in their conversation when the words she was
      saying stopped being hers and started being his. Or maybe they were
      her words. Does it really matter? In many respects, they’re
      basically the same person, aren’t they? Kindred spirits in blood
      and perspective, the puppet masters of the respective games they
      like to believe they’re playing.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">But you already knew that, right?</p>
