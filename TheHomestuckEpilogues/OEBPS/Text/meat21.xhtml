      <p class="dave">DAVE: im not being a xenophobe</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Karkat doesn’t respond immediately. He
      shuffles his feet to the edge of the outcropping they’re standing
      on and stares down at the brood pit, where the Mother Grub of Earth
      C is squelching out unfertilized jelly.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: dude you know im not a xenophobe</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">No answer. This silence makes Dave
      actually back up for three seconds and think about what the hell
      just came out of his mouth. He’s worried that maybe he said
      something wrong here, that he was being horribly insensitive inside
      a place that’s probably holy ground for the few Alternia-born
      trolls left alive. Maybe flippant xenophobia isn’t the best look in
      front of your alien pseudo-boyfriend when it comes to jamming about
      the irreconcilable biological differences between your species.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Dave could definitely be handling this situation
      with a certain measure of restraint or grace. But he’s got my
      genes, so he decides to handle it a different way than that.</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean thats what this whole election thing
      is about</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: well</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: that and the economy</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: lets not lose TOTAL sight of the economy in
      this critical discussion</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: but im almost as passionate about this troll
      speciesism thing as i am about the economy which you may not have
      known is my number one issue</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: but my other wheelhouse is like</p>

      and shit?</p>

      real intently at the jelly.</p>

      MY ENTIRE FUCKING SPECIES RIGHT HERE.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU EVER THINK THAT THIS MIGHT BE A
      MONUMENTAL MOMENT FOR ME?</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THAT I MIGHT BE AWESTRUCK AT THE PURE
      MAJESTY OF THIS SIGHT?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave comes to the edge of the
      outcropping, standing shoulder to shoulder with Karkat as he too
      observes the majesty of translucent goo getting birthed out of an
      alien asshole.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Karkat’s got a strange expression on his face, cast
      half in shadow and half in orange light. Dave winces as the grub’s
      nasty slime chute sputters out a bunch of air bubbles. It’s a
      gross, gurgling fart that goes on basically forever.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah but it is totally disgusting right</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I CAN’T FUCKING BELIEVE YOU</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT PART OF THIS IS DISGUSTING?</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS IT THE SLOW DEFLATING OF ITS DISTENDED
      ABDOMEN?</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THE SOUND OF DOZENS OF SEGMENTED LEGS
      CLACKING AGAINST ITS EXOSKELETON?</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THE UNFERTILIZED SLURRY BEING SLOWLY
      SQUEEZED FROM ITS OVIPOSITIONAL SPHINCTER?</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS THAT IT? IS THAT DISGUSTING TO YOU
      DAVE?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: kind of</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: ...</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU’RE RIGHT</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT’S HORRIBLE</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST I WOULD HAVE
      GLADLY GONE THE REST OF MY WRETCHED EXISTENCE WITHOUT EVER SEEING
      THIS.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: its like when you squish the toothpaste down
      in the middle</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: only the tube is filled with fetus juice</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Im Sorry But I Can Hear You From Down
      Here</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Did You Want To Talk To Me Or Are You
      Intent On Performing An Impromptu And Very Unfunny Comedy Act On My
      Front Step</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: oh hey kanaya</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave grabs Karkat by the wrist of his
      oversized sweater and they skid down the narrow walkway into the
      mouth of the crater. Kanaya steps out from beneath the canopy where
      she was doing grub science, wiping her hands on a silk cloth. She’s
      glowing. Her skin, I mean. Her mood can be politely described as
      pensive. Still, she smiles at the sight of old friends.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: whats shaking sis</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Must You Always Call Me That</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: nah but it does feel pretty rad to say</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: like wow my sister in law is an alien how
      cool is that</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i love our awesome planet where everyone is
      free to form xenophilic family units without fear of government
      interference or reprisal</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: which is a totally smooth segue into the
      topic at hand</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THAT WASN’T SMOOTH AT ALL.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IN FACT I DON’T THINK IT WOULD BE
      POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RAISE THE SUBJECT WE’VE COME TO TALK ABOUT IN A
      MORE OSTENTATIOUSLY AWFUL AND AWKWARD WAY.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JUST BECAUSE YOU DID THAT STUPID
      LITTLE...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Here, Karkat pauses to imitate a very
      common Davism that involves two hands and a double-wrist swivel.
      It’s an incredibly good imitation, because he sees this particular
      bit of body language like ten times a day.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: ...MOTION WITH YOUR HANDS DOESN’T MAKE IT
      SMOOTH</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: no see the reason its smooth is because i was
      the one who did it</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i got inherent smoothness and its a quality
      that transfers to everything i say and do</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: also that thing i do with my hands isnt
      stupid</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: its cool</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT’S THE STUPIDEST THING I’VE EVER SEEN
      AND YOU DO IT LIKE TEN TIMES A DAY.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT EVEN IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: im dropping a beat</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: like im using a turntable and scratching one
      song into another</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: all smooth and shit</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE TRYING TO FOLD
      LAUNDRY YOU FORGOT TO IRON.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: dude you have never once in your life ironed
      a shirt</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE BASIC MECHANICS OF
      YOUR EARTH CUSTOMS DAVE.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya regards them with a thin-lipped
      smile that is equal measures patronizing and fond.</p>

      FROM ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS.</p>

      FROM THE PERSON WHO DECIDED HER NARCISSISTIC OBSESSION WITH BEING
      THE ONE TO HATCH THE MOTHER GRUB WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN NOT
      SEEDING OUR PLANET WITH A STOPGAP SYSTEM OF REPRODUCTION THAT WOULD
      CAUSE SYSTEMIC SPECIESISM TO OSSIFY INTO SOCIETY FOR 5000
      YEARS.</p>

      Consequences To The Decisions We Made Regarding The Foundation Of
      This Society That Were Not Foreseen Or Ideal</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: But I Do Not Think It Is Productive To
      Attribute These Resultant Troubles To A Single Decision Or
      Individual</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Stands In The Way Of Our Efforts To
      Address Them</p>

      You</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya reaches out to put a hand on
      Karkat’s head. He doesn’t duck away in time, and she gives him an
      affectionate, matronly hair-ruffle between his horns. She keeps her
      hand there and pulls him a step closer so that she can speak softly
      to him. Her voice travels high in the empty cavern, but her tone is
      tender and private.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: While I Know That It Is Difficult For You
      To Take A Direct Compliment</p>

      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Its Basically Nothing To Ask Me To Do It
      Again Now That The Threat Is Far More</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya pauses here, choosing her words
      more carefully than usual. She takes her hand off Karkat’s head and
      puts two fingers to her lip. Karkat’s eyes follow the motion, wide
      and bright as dollar coins.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">She lifts up the hem of her skirt and
      jumps in. Dave is watching her, but Karkat’s looking
      contemplatively at his entwined hands. Kanaya’s right: it’s almost
      excruciating for him to take a completely unironic compliment,
      especially face-to-face, like what she just said to him. I
      understand this about Karkat. It’s one of the precious few things
      he and I have in common.</p>
      <p class="dirk">We internalize and project the quality in very
      different ways, however, which is why I’m going to win.</p>

      description of one of their many dead friends. Kanaya carefully
      steps between the puddles of brood jelly and approaches the Mother
      Grub. She rests an ear against the rise of its massive stomach,
      then taps the shell with two perfectly manicured fingernails.</p>

      adorably cartoonish synchronicity. What was this all for,
      indeed?</p>
      <p class="dirk">That’s a good question. Morality is a cultural
      construct. It’s pure ego for any of them to believe that their
      personal interpretation of it will result in the most effective
      laws.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya turns her head and bites her lip.
      Her thin fingers clutch at the hem of her shirt. She starts
      flickering a little, like a lightbulb in a heavy storm. The mood in
      here’s just all over the place. Dave, sensing how uncomfortable
      he’s made everything, cranks up the irreverence in his tone. When
      you put a foot in your mouth, shoving it all the way through your
      intestines and pulling it out your ass is a valid tactic, he seems
      to believe.</p>

      Going To Stop Talking</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Her thumb is anxiously tapping on her
      wife’s name in her contacts list. She walks briskly to the other
      side of the cave for privacy, pulling the curtain of her makeshift
      lab shut. At the other side of the cavern, Dave and Karkat bicker
      about what their combo kids would look like, in the event that they
      decided to stop being such laughable wusses and began fornicating
      like two cartoon animals of different species who have given into
      their lust. And the day hell freezes over, maybe their kids could
      even play in the snow.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Kanaya puts her phone to one ear and her hand to
      the other. Rose’s line rings for a long time. It’s unusual, she
      thinks. Rose rarely leaves her phone unattended. Personally, I
      don’t think it’s odd, because I’m currently watching Rose lying
      unconscious on my workshop floor.</p>
      <p class="dirk">I’m guessing Kanaya is going to be pretty surprised
      when it’s not her wife who picks up. But she’ll have to deal with
      it, because I’m the one holding the phone, and Rose is in
      absolutely no condition to be having a conversation with anyone.
      Not even her cherished bride.</p>
