      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Why Are You With Rose</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: What Is Going On</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Why would you think something was going
      on?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: By which I mean, why would you automatically
      assume that what’s going on has a sinister overtone.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Did I Say That I Suspected Something
      Sinister Was Going On</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Not with your words, no.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But in the grand scheme of things, isn’t
      something always “going on”? Why would you even ask “what is going
      on” if you didn’t assume that the thing going on was both abnormal
      and untoward.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Now I Definitely Think That
      Something Sinister Is Going On Because You Are Obviously Trying To
      Distract Me With Semantics</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: A tactic I’m sure you’re familiar with.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Excuse Me</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m just making an observation. You know your
      wife pretty well.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: ...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know all of her tricks, all her little
      personality quirks. You’re confident that you know everything about
      her.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But for some reason, you have no idea where
      she is right now.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: What Are You Getting At</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Nothing. Just making sure we both have a
      clear view of the situation.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Laying out the playing field, as it were.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Okay</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Am Going To Give You Another Chance</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Why Dont We Start This Conversation Over
      Again And You Can Say The Correct Thing This Time</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sure.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Hello</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Excuse Me But I Would Like To Speak With
      My Wife Rose</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Whose Phone I Do Believe I Am Calling</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: As Even These Primitive Human Smartphones
      Have Acceptably Accurate Caller ID Technology</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry, Rose can’t come to the phone right
      now.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: She is otherwise... <em>occupied</em>.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Where Is She</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: She’s at my place.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Im Sorry What</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose Is Extremely Ill And Should Not Be
      Leaving The House Alone</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: What Is She Doing At Your Place</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Chillaxing, whilst we discuss the inevitable
      heat death of the universe and the unknowable, solitary nature of
      human consciousness.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I See</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: If She Is Capable Of Such Abstract
      Polemics Why Is It That She Cannot Speak With Me</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s a damned good question.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: One that will undoubtedly benefit from
      further exploration over the course of the next abstract polemic I
      have with her.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Yes, I admit. I’m just fucking with her
      at this point. But can you blame me, when she’s making it so
      easy?</p>
      <p class="dirk">Kanaya loves Rose, but sometimes love just isn’t
      enough. Sometimes what you need is <em>understanding.</em></p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: You Are Testing My Patience Sorely
      Dirk</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, I’ve gotten pretty good at that.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Just ask my fans.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Am Not Making A Joke</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Me neither.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I don’t really “do” jokes?</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Neither Do I</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I do often make statements which hold varying
      degrees of irony, acerbic wit, or dry expressions of amusement.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes That Roughly Describes Many Of The
      Remarks I Make As Well</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I knew you’d understand.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: However My Commiseration On This Matter
      Should Not Be Mistaken For A Gesture Of Friendship Or Camaraderie
      At This Moment</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then it seems we’re at an impasse.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Wont Be An Impasse For Very Long</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Im Coming Over Immediately</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: To Retrieve My Wife</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If that’s what you want.</p>
      <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Tell Her That Im On My Way</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sure. I’ll get right on that.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">I hang up on her.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Rose looks up from where she’s suffering on the
      floor. The shadows around her are growing. She stares at me with
      glassy eyes.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Is everything okay?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah. Just a telemarketer.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know how those carapacians can be when
      they want to sell you some chess shit.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Impossible to get ’em off the phone.</p>
