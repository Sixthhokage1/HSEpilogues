      <p class="rose">ROSE: Customarily, we speak in favorable terms
      about “getting to know each other” as people.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Humans, I mean. I doubt trolls are as fixated
      on this concept as one that is widely understood to have
      preconceived merit.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: The more we learn about each other, the more
      the barriers between us fall and the closer we become.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: And since birth, this idea is stationed in
      the part of each human mind that is perfectly immune to the dangers
      of challenge or scrutiny.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: To grow closer, to know each other, is what
      it means to embrace our mutual humanity. What it means to be
      vulnerable. What it means to realize an intimacy implied as a form
      of divine birthright. And to question this in any way is to succumb
      to dysfunction, to pathological insularity, to sociological
      sin.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It is to renounce humanity itself, is it
      not?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yo, hold on a sec. This shit is dynamite, I
      promise.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Gotta take care of something...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose’s phone is ringing, and I know I’m
      in for an encore of my last dead-end conversation with Kanaya, so I
      block her number. I’d like to be able to attend to Rose in peace.
      It’s only cordial for me to give the greater percentage of my
      attention to someone I actually invited over. The nagging wife can
      hold her horses.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Rose isn’t speaking to me directly. She’s been
      relocated to somewhere in the workshop a little more comfortable
      than the fucking floor. There’s a serviceable couch along the far
      wall, placed there for visitors but never once used for that
      purpose until now. I cleared off the spare parts and circuit boards
      that were piled up there, and laid her down in the reclined
      position she’s in now.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Her head is in her hands again, hair falling over
      her shoulders. Her face is entirely hidden from me. Her shadow has
      faded to light behind her, assuming the shape of a Rose-like
      apparition. I nod to her, and she continues. When she speaks, it’s
      almost as if it’s the apparition that’s doing the talking.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But is it really a good idea?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: To know a person?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Know them inside and out, so thoroughly that
      no secrets remain?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: If two people were to know each other in such
      a complete way, what remains of their individuality?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If you’re going there, we might as well start
      at the bottom and define what an “individual” even is.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh dear god.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">I place my hand on my chin and broadcast
      the appearance of being deeply pensive about philosophy all of a
      sudden. She gulps hard, broadcasting her grim realization that I
      have indeed become serious as shit about this. Literally any kind
      of intellectual pablum could pour out of my mouth any second, and
      she’s not prepared. For all she knows, I’m about to start quoting
      Kierkegaard.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Please don’t start quoting Kierkegaard.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’ve never even read Kierkegaard, have
      you.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Like you have?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hey, where I come from, Wikipedia is a
      venerated literary resource. So if I told you I boned the hell up
      on his pages, you gotta believe me. That’s not meant as like, a
      punchline or anything.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m a really, really well-read dude.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But there were only two human beings alive
      where you came from.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Who exactly were the academic cognoscenti of
      your era to determine which sources were deemed respectable?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: That would be me, obviously.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Ok.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I suppose you’re going to tell me you haven’t
      read enough Wikipedia articles on loads of scholarly shit to fancy
      yourself an elite academic by 25th century standards as well?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: No, I guess I have.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I’d be one of the top intellectuals by that
      measure.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: A measure set by, I guess, literally one
      solitary self-absorbed teen boy for the express purpose of making
      himself feel clever.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Absolutely correct.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Pretty astounding, when you think about it.
      That...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: What?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: That apparently in any given era the standard
      for depth of intellectual mastery is inversely proportional to the
      depth of the ocean.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Really makes you think.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Does it?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: No.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s one hell of an observation,
      regardless.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Considering we’ve firmly established the fact
      that we’ve both read the entire Wikipedia page on self-determinism,
      like, <em>possibly</em> more than once, even.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Let’s have a totally amateur debate on
      philosophy. Hit me with the classics.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Um.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ll go first.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: “God is dead.”</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: That’s a good one.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Careful where you say that. You could really
      ruffle some feathers out there.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m not a fucking idiot. I keep my potent
      rhetorical weapons of pure logic safely holstered at all times.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You go.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: “I think therefore I am.”</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Solid.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Check it out though.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: “The Hegelian dialectic on history.”</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Holy shit.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Not sure I can keep up with this.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: How about,</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: “Subjectivity is truth.”</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Wrong, but valid.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Try this on for fucking size.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Late 19th century existential phenomenology
      pre-supposes that free will is a thing.”</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think I bookmarked that page.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Can’t back you up there.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But what if there’s no free will.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: You didn’t put that in quotes.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Is this a hackneyed reference, or are you
      just actually riffing now?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m riffing.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Asking the hard questions.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s about time someone had the balls to.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, I’ve always been underappreciated for
      my brutal intellectual honesty. Even when I was living alone in the
      middle of the ocean, if you can believe it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I think free will is a thing, sure.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Are you sure about that?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: ...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Haven’t we spent the entire day having a
      feelings jam on how none of us got here by accident?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Our lives were meticulously planned from
      clone-ception up through this very post-canon moment we find
      ourselves riffing in about the very free will we probably don’t
      even have.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Don’t you think it’s all a little too
      convenient?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: This seriously is just a conversation between
      two stoned people now.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: The bad kind, where neither one even gets to
      be high.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Seriously, Rose. Do you think that you have
      free will?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Stand up.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">She tries to stand up, but I haven’t
      narratively allowed it yet. Her hands don’t even move. She tenses,
      then relaxes into the couch again, giving up on the attempt. She
      attributes it to exhaustion, an all-encompassing sense of weakness
      due to her condition. Of course, she <em>has</em> been weakened by
      her condition, and thus she suspects nothing.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Never mind.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You shouldn’t be moving around much in your
      condition, remember?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ll sit.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">I sit beside her, and cross my legs
      casually. It’s all done in one fluid motion in a way that serves as
      a seamless transition between the points I’m making, like a
      magician asking the volunteer to hold his handkerchief as he
      continues his verbal misdirection uninterrupted. It’s done deftly
      enough that she doesn’t notice how close I end up sitting to her.
      To be honest, I don’t even notice myself until I’ve done it. I
      continue speaking, and she remains rapt. But now even I can’t help
      but wonder where I’m going with this.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Logically speaking, individuality is a
      collection of processes and properties, interrelations of matter
      and experience all bundled together.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Your experience and processes don’t want to
      be bundled together anymore.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">A moment goes by, and she’s quiet,
      perhaps puzzling over what I said. Then I remember I haven’t
      narratively permitted a response. I’m forgetting myself, like a
      fool. Distracted by the surprise my own actions have caused me. I
      resolve to stay focused, remain in control. I let her speak.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t understand.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You do, though.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: We’ve been talking about it, but using
      different concepts.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Your Ultimate Self, that which is revealed
      when the mind’s partitions are stripped away, and all potentiality
      of who you are and what you could have been flow together.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Those are the experiences and processes that
      are refusing to stay bundled, that’s what your body can’t endure.
      The unbundling itself is your mind coming apart.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Because you’re not as strong as me. Not
      yet.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But you can be.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m working on that.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But for now, I’m focused on stabilizing you
      with my own expanding consciousness.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s enveloping you now, in a way you can’t
      see. Keeping your thoughts solid, your identity anchored to your
      physical form as it strains to hold itself together.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You can’t see it, what I’m talking about. But
      I can help you.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I can help you see what I see, if only for a
      little while.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: All you have to do is open your eyes.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Maybe what you see will help you through
      this.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Is that what you’d like?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: ...Rose?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Her eyes are shut, her look of
      concentration speaking to the migraine she must be fighting now.
      Small beads of sweat appear on her forehead. She won’t respond. And
      not because I haven’t allowed it.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Rose, stop being a fucking martyr and open
      your eyes.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose opens her eyes. Not her physical
      eyes. She opens the others easily, internally, beholding a field of
      perception elsewhere entirely. They see what I want her to see.
      That which quietly desires to be seen. She loses track of my voice,
      which begins to mingle with these words.</p>
      <p class="dirk">I offer her my hand. My physical hand. Without
      opening her physical eyes, she lifts her hand from her lap and
      places it in mine. I put my other hand on top of hers, and wait as
      she drifts beyond the torments of her unbundling mind. My words
      feel like her own intimate thoughts and my distant voice in the
      room at the same time.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Open your eyes wider.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: What do you see?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">We’re not in my workshop anymore.
      Physically, yes, we’re still here. But on a higher textual plane,
      we’ve pulled back from that, from Earth C itself. Rose takes a
      shuddering breath and runs an invisible pair of hands afforded by
      her new sight over the narrative whole cloth, and begins smoothing
      out the wrinkles.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I see... John.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Doing exactly what you told him to do, like a
      good boy.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: ...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: What’s there to be upset about? You knew this
      was how it was supposed to go down.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: He could have made another choice.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then where would we be?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Who knows.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: No, that wasn’t a rhetorical question.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If John could have made another choice, then
      you can see what it is.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If it can happen, then it’s been written. And
      if it’s been written, you can read it right now.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I... don’t know if I want to see.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If there’s no free will, then there’s no
      regret either.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Look harder.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">She looks harder.</p>
      <p class="dirk">I’m not going to describe what she sees. First of
      all, that would be spoiling it. Unless you already know, in which
      case, I guess what’s taking place here qualifies as something
      closer to dramatic irony. But if you really want to see it for
      yourself, stop what you’re doing, <a href="flip-pro_cover.xhtml">flip the whole thing over</a>, and
      begin again. I’ll be right here when you get back, waiting. Trust
      me, no one’s going anywhere.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: So, what do you think?</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s difficult to say.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I suppose there are negatives and positives.
      I can’t say if that option would be any better or worse than what
      we’re experiencing now.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Whichever way our fate unravels there’s too
      much of... something.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Too much blood, too much sugar.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: I almost can’t see through it.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s as if our extra-canon reality, our
      surroundings, our actions and their consequences...</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: They’ve all lost the ability to blend the
      ingredients responsibly.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Do you know what I mean?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yes.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: As if the moment we entered the victory
      state, everything began to slowly congeal.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: And when John made his decision, it
      accelerated the process. The congealing intensified, causing a sort
      of grotesque conceptual clumping.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Concentrating the constituent properties of
      consumption into unbearable doses.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Like when you get to the bottom of a sweet
      drink, and all that’s left is syrup.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">It’s growing dark around her again. The
      apparition she’s been projecting behind her fades, and she starts
      to bleed light and shadow in all directions. Her physical eyes are
      open now, and shining bright. It’s a striking sight. She’s
      beautiful, actually—diaphanous and disheveled and filled with the
      limitless light of metaspiritual curiosity.</p>
      <p class="dirk">But for all the effervescent mysticism of her
      otherworldly becoming, I feel like this is the very first time I’m
      truly seeing her for what she’s always been to me. She’s my
      daughter in every sense of the word. My equal, my mirror.</p>
      <p class="dirk">It used to be odd to consider it. A technical fact
      I’d accepted as a genetic reality, but nothing that could ever
      quite penetrate down to the soul. But in this moment it doesn’t
      feel strange at all. It feels right, suddenly. And I know she must
      feel the same way. There’s no way she doesn’t. All she needs is a
      nudge in the right direction.</p>
      <p class="dirk">We’re family. We belong together. And after years
      of micromanaging the inconsistent and confused desires of total
      imbeciles, wouldn’t it be a relief to have someone by my side who
      understood me?</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re almost there.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: All your eyes are open, Rose.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Now all you need to do is take a step off the
      precipice.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’ll be a long fall. But I’ll catch you.</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: But what if the person you catch...</p>
      <p class="rose">ROSE: Isn’t me anymore?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Who gives a fuck. She’ll be better.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">And there, right there, is the moment she
      lets go. She uncouples herself from the creaking, buckling
      partitions of her physical mind, and her consciousness dissolves
      into a space more vast, a domain given structure and order by my
      words and conviction. She’s permitted the barriers between us to
      fall, to allow us to know each other more perfectly. As she was
      saying before, to resist this, to question it in any way, would be
      to succumb to dysfunction, to pathological insularity, to
      sociological <em>sin</em>. Would it not be to renounce humanity
      itself?</p>
      <p class="dirk">And yet, ironically, renouncing our humanity is
      exactly what we have arguably just done. Good riddance, I say.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Her body should be dead now. But I’m holding it
      together until I can implement the more permanent solution I have
      in mind. All in due time. For now, what is there to do but savor
      this moment? To appreciate her final waking minutes as a being of
      flesh and blood? She turns, and the light from her eyes is
      blinding. It dims a bit as she lowers her eyelids. She regards me
      with an almost unbearably bright adoration. The kind that’s
