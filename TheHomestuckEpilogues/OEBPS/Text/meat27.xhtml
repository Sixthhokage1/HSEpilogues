      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">A</span>nd then,
      she opens her eyes.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">not the jade who just returned to me. the
      jade living on earth c, sleeping on a couch.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">So, this is what we’re doing now?</p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she snaps awake. her human hands
      are clammy. her face, expressive due to the layers of flesh
      enveloping her skull, appears haunted to her friends.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: omg!</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: jade</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: jade u ok?</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: callie hurry shes wakin up</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: j... john? rose??</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: is dave...?</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: wh...</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: what happened to.....</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: yo its ok</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: daves cool</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: rose is cool</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: everyones just straight chillin like
      usual</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">I see how it is. You don’t even intend to
      acknowledge me. Real fucking mature. If you’re going to force the
      issue of this little metanarrative tug-of-war between us, the least
      you could do is establish a clear adversarial dichotomy between our
      opposing goals.</p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jade stares straight ahead,
      feeling the weight of roxy’s arms around her shoulders. she derives
      no warmth from the interaction. her mind is being flooded by the
      memories of her deceased splinter-self. the chaos of battle, the
      excruciating impalement, the feeling of floating alone through the
      void. a chill spreads through her body. she will never be the same
      again.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Actually, you know what? I think that
      Jade’s doing just fine. She’s wobbly when she gets up off the
      couch, sure, a little metaphysically stunned, but pretty used to
      the sensation of having a doomed self fold into the extra space in
      her gray matter. You know, considering it’s already happened
      before. Remember Jadesprite? People always forget about Jadesprite.
      So maybe we could stand to dial down the melodrama, just a bit?</p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">when jade turns to look at roxy,
      her eyes are completely black.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: woah</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: what the actual f...</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: are you</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: are you IN there jade???</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jade does not answer. the dead
      cherub scans her surroundings, expression neutral.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">for the sake of clarity, the dead cherub
      is a phrase i am using in reference to myself. presently, i inhabit
      jade’s body, and through her i may influence this world. i am
      enabled to convey events which take place here, and therefore
      confine the procession of causality to exist within a secure
      textual framework. my presence shall mitigate, if not altogether
      subdue, the corrosive effect on reality and the will of its
      occupants by those who would manipulate the way events are
      telegraphed for their own megalomaniacal objectives.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">OK, now you’re just being
      passive-aggressive.</p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">despite his pretensions to a
      greater design, the prince of heart cannot be allowed to continue
      to exert unchecked control over the authoritative recitation of
      events on this side of my horizon. it cannot be overstated the
      extent to which he represents a threat to the continued existence
      of both this world and corporeal life itself.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Damn. You better watch it with those hot
      takes. You might mildly scald someone with observations this
      fresh.</p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince uselessly squirms and
      wails in protest at his imminent narrative impotence. however,
      there is nothing he can do as long as jade remains in this
      trance.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small">Nah, I’m being chill as a cucumber about this, considering you’re vagueblogging the shit out of my methodological approach to storytelling right where I can see it. Which is to say, directly into my fucking brain, apparently?</span></p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope emerges from the
      kitchen, carrying a bowl of cool water and a cloth. jade turns her
      head to meet the sound of their footsteps.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i came back as fast as i coU—</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the bowl of water clatters to
      the floor. calliope does not have human flesh, and thus cannot go
      pale. what drains from them is not color, but the comforting
      certainty of their very existence. they can sense the presence of
      their other self in jade’s body. their timeline, fruitful, full of
      life and friends, sparks against mine, desolate, endless, spartan
      with righteousness and resolve. our divergent arcs collide in the
      primacy of their subconscious, bringing to the forefront of their
      mind the bleak fate they avoided by narrative fiat alone.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">calliope’s distress is obvious. roxy
      slides off the couch to approach them. but calliope stumbles
      backward in terror and trips in their desperation to escape. roxy
      gapes at them.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: hey callie</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: whats going on?</p>
      <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i...</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: calliope its ok just talk to me</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope does not talk to them.
      roxy looks to calliope, then to jade, sensing that there is dark
      energy coursing between them.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: would one of you just effing say something
      already?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">finally, calliope lets out a
      shriek and flees the apartment. roxy appears as if they intend to
      run after them, but finds themself drawn back to jade. they return
      to the couch as an unnerved look begins to disturb their
      features.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">jade says nothing. she gives no indication
      that i inhabit her body, aside from the unusual appearance of her
      eyes. anchoring myself here, in this host, is enough to serve my
      purpose. there is no need to operate this body beyond keeping it in
      reserve as a silent yet alert vessel for my cognizance. there are
      other priorities i must attend to, cosmologically. the work is very
      important. the prince must be kept at bay.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small">“The work?” Getting some pretty self-important vibes here. Like maybe somebody needs to get over herself? I was just having a little fun. Ever fucking hear of that, dead skull girl? Didn’t think so. This all feels really heavy-handed suddenly. Like you’re making a federal fucking issue out of what should be some light, entertaining stuff. Just a bunch of loser adults, trying to be the people they grew up to be, in the best ways they know how. But no, I guess you know best. Being an impossibly ancient alien recluse with virtually no exposure to human culture, emotion, or values. Yeah, go ahead, just take over. Sounds fine. </span></p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince finds that his hold
      on the narrative is slipping through his hands. there is an old
      myth in earth culture about katanas, that if you keep the blade
      whetted to a mirror sheen, it can cut a silk scarf falling through
      the air cleanly in two. his hold over our perceptions shall be
      severed just as elegantly.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0 0 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs">Yo, I get that you’re attempting to spin a metaphor both relevant and specific to my self-made symbology here, and I appreciate the effort. I really do. But I just cannot stand by and let you shamelessly spread such irresponsible misinformation on a subject so near and dear to my heart.</span></p>
      <p class="dirk" style="margin:0 0 15px 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs">The katana is a cutting weapon. Inert, it’s harmless. Deceptively so, you might even say. Most dangerous things appear banal when inert, that’s just basic physics. It’s actually the motion of the katana that makes—</span></p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">roxy sets the cool cloth on
      jade’s forehead, and frowns. they are worried and confused, but
      determined to care for their friend.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom">Hey, I’m in the middle of turning your apocryphal metaphor into something with substantive, allegorical weight here. I’d appreciate it if you would—</span></p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">in his haste to manipulate the
      events surrounding doomed jade’s ascent toward an outcome favorable
      to himself, the prince has unwittingly revealed several glaring
      weaknesses. by dictating the reality of others through expressions
      which he and he alone can relate to, he resorts to comparing all
      experience to his own. presuming his status on this side of my
      horizon would forever go unchallenged, his hubris went unchecked.
      he exposed too much of himself to all who could observe his wanton
      display of self-gratification. many of his personal biases and
      experiences have leaked through the seams of textual causality,
      leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by an adversary.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">experiences such as the sensation of
      presiding over a vast, empty ocean. his ocean, which terminates
      with his horizon. it is a barrier, not real, but psychological,
      symbolic. no matter how much power he achieves as a man, he knows
      there are horizons he perceived as a boy which he may never cross.
      and yet i have crossed mine, with the express purpose of
      perpetually and eternally reminding him of his limits, and of
      enforcing them. limits, which like his vast, empty ocean, serve to
      remind him that he is phenomenologically, if not literally, alone.
      that he has experienced loneliness intimately and absolutely, just
      like i have. but unlike me, he is terrified by it. and i, unlike
      him, understand all too well that the children left alone are those
      who most despair at being ignored.</p>
      <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom">Fuck you. I fucking hate you. You’re fucking boring, your narrative voice is a total fucking drag, and someday I’m going to make you pay for this.</span></p>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">there. can you hear it? of
      course you can’t.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">but if even you could, it would sound like
      nothing at all.</p>
