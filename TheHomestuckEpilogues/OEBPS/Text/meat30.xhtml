      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">karkat both looks and feels
      uncomfortable in his red and gray suit. he is tired from an
      afternoon of campaigning in the consort kingdom. jake is jaunting
      rigorously, as he put it, up the ridge of the mountain behind his
      mansion. every now and then, he pauses to accommodate the pace of
      his less limber friends.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      UP A PRE-ASSASSINATED PRESIDENT TO A FRENZIED ELECTORATE. AWESOME
      STRATEGY!</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">karkat’s tirade is interrupted
      as he trips over a protruding tree root. dave, who has been
      cheating on their hike by hovering very slightly off the ground
      rather than walking, catches karkat before his face hits the dirt.
      he sets his companion upright and continues to guide him with his
      hand on his back as he walks, the way an older human does with a
      small child who is learning to ride a bicycle.</p>

      us would waste time climbing a mountain instead of like</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: its pretty fucked up trust me</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: like she already owns the major method of
      information dissemination and now she wants to be the one
      ultimately in control of what information gets disseminated</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: do you really think one person should have
      all that power</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: which is why you should back us and our
      campaign</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: our campaign slogan for the purpose of this
      conversation only is “hey isnt it cool how were not jane and also
      we dont want to own everything”</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: on a more personal note</p>

      <p class="jake">JAKE: Your poorly optimized billboards about “huge

      <p class="jake">JAKE: These advertisements play at all hours of the
      night my good man. One can hardly get a wink of sleep!</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah but at least we paid for it out of
      campaign dollars instead of spinelessly setting up super pacs to
      spew out propaganda for us</p>

      <p class="dave">DAVE: oh yeah</p>

      having had the concept of the “super pac” laboriously explained in
      his presence more than once. in his estimation, there are few
      individuals on this world who would benefit less from an in-depth
      discussion of political financing procedure than jake english.</p>

      gracious compliment not every little pleasantry need be taken with
      such blasted literalism!</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: And i appreciate that youre trying to sway my
      political favor into your bungalow with a bit of the old elbow
      grease and cajolery even if your methods are wont to veer into full
      throated invective in virtually every single exchange no matter how
      harmless the topic.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: And i truly mean it when i say i DO
      appreciate the effort. Both at the brownnosing as well as the
      dubious restraint when it comes to impugning my noodle.</p>

      wonder...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jake slices a hand through the
      air, determined to display his newfound autonomy. it’s growing by
      the minute now that his thought process has been severed from the
      prince’s grip. an old confidence fills him as he continues to
      speak, a feeling of inner freedom he hasn’t enjoyed in some
      time.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Why should i side with either of you?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Flattery is all well and good but i hardly
      think i would bother casting my knickers in with anyones lot based
      on the quality of praise or for that matter withholding them due to
      having my ego bruised from a verbal drubbing.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Im not entirely ignorant of the rules of this
      jamboree. I understand that whoever i endorse will have a good
      chance of winning on nothing but my good word.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: So why should i trust ANYONE trying to win my
      favor right now? Do you have ANY case to make which does not
      involve glowing accounts of my muscular bottom???</p>
      </div>
      <span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom">I know it seems like an objectively good thing from some pithy moral standpoint to let everyone in this little drama Jane’s cooked up make their “own decisions,” but trust me: Jake isn’t thinking for himself any more than he was while being indirectly controlled. Everything he’s thinking and feeling right now is merely reactive. He’s like a mostly dead bug twitching around on the last of its hemolymph after getting its head cut off. Under my guidance, he was like an ant being influenced by the cordyceps fungus. You can’t really call one of these “better” than the other, but at least the latter is being directed toward some greater purpose.</span>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">for a moment, jake thinks he
      hears something. a miniscule voice, prattling along vaingloriously.
      but he realizes it’s only a tiny insect buzzing about his ear. a
      gnat-like presence of absolutely no consequence. he simply waves it
      away.</p>

      <p class="calliope-dead">karkat unwinds from dave’s loose embrace,
      takes a deep breath, and clambers up the ridge to speak with jake
      in a more personable proximity. he has learned new methods for
      connecting with others on the campaign trail. how to speak broadly,
      with sweeping conviction, and yet create a sense of intimacy when
      addressing an individual. he has learned to come across as one who
      was once a leader, and could be again.</p>

      PRECEDENT.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SHE’S INDIRECT. SHE’S PRIVILEGED. SHE’S
      CONCERNED WITH HOW THINGS *LOOK* RATHER THAN HOW THINGS *ARE*.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO MATTER HOW NICE SHE WAS WHEN YOU WERE
      KIDS, HER DEDICATION TO THE APPEARANCE OF THAT “NICENESS” HAS
      ALREADY LED HER DOWN A PATH OF CORRUPTION AND DUPLICITY.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BECAUSE WHEN YOU LIVE INSIDE A SKIN
      THAT’S A LIE, YOU’LL EITHER GROW TO FIT IT, OR COLLAPSE UNDER THE
      UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN SHIT-SPEWING COGNITIVE
      DISSONANCE.</p>
      <p class="karkat">KARKAT: TRUST ME, I FUCKING KNOW, BECAUSE I USED

      SHIT***!</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jake chews on these remarks for
      a minute. he loves jane and dirk dearly. he has loved both of them
      for years, on and off, in multiple fashions and configurations, in
      accordance with the human understanding of this feeling. he thinks
      it could break jane’s heart were he to oppose her. and yet, hasn’t
      she fired the first shot by broadcasting such scandalous things
      about him in the media? and it was so soon after they’d nearly had
      an intimate reconciliation. the more he thinks on it, the more jake
      struggles to believe in the sincerity behind jane’s friendship with
      him.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">and the prince?</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">dirk, as he knows him, hasn’t been given
      much thought by jake recently. jake has been savoring the fruits of
      a mental liberation he is barely aware of, let alone capable of
      comprehending. when he considers crossing dirk, he’s not afraid of
      making him angry or hurting his feelings. he’s simply always wanted
      to avoid disappointing him. and yet, with the cognitive cloud of
      dirk’s influence dispelled, jake now cannot shake the feeling that
      the best course of action would be the one that asserts the most
      independence from dirk, disappointment be damned.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">and to whatever extent the prince intends
      to put jake’s life in jeopardy, for now, his agency remains safely
      obscured from his sniper sight.</p>
