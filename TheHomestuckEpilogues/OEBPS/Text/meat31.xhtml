      munching her way through another tin of human fatherly tobacco as
      john crawls into the back seat. this has been their ritual for
      several days. precisely how many, they couldn’t say. between her
      frequent naps and his diligence in keeping a lookout for any
      additional survivors, they have been losing track of time. john,
      eyes unfocused, stares at the expanse of nothingness. perhaps he
      imagines it, but it seems as if the emptiness itself is curving
      against the staggering weight of the black hole they orbit.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">he hasn’t seen any sign of vriska. he’s
      seen no one at all. it’s just him, terezi, and the sky on all
      sides. he scoots back to lean against the car door, drawing his
      knees up to his chest, unsure how to act around terezi or how much
      room to give her.</p>

      where she is touching him, and her lower lip is visibly trembling.
      he nods, and she slowly lets go of his arm.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">they are silent for a minute. they both

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">john had gotten so used to the
      pain, he’d almost forgotten about it. he looks down at the place
      where his shirt has grown stiff from the congealed blood. now that
      he dwells on it, he can feel the ache again, both from the tooth
      piercing his flesh and, more insidiously, from the poison it has
      been delivering into his bloodstream.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">he rolls his eyes. terezi
      produces her cane and unsheathes the blade in one fluid motion. the
      metal rasps against the grain of its sheath, rather loudly.
      <span class="dirk type-bs type-hs-bottom">I’m sorry, what? No
      it doesn’t.</span> the noise resounds throughout the sealed
      interior of the car <span class="dirk type-bs type-hs-bottom">Actually, drawing a sword is pretty quiet. It only makes that sound in the movies.</span>and rings through john’s skull like a gunshot.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">he holds still. her eyebrows are
      knitted with fierce determination. she sets a hand on his thigh and
      draws the blade up under his shirt. he shivers, letting out a
      breathy laugh at the coolness of the metal against his bare chest.
      there is a pinch when the congealed, bloody fabric rips from his
      skin.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">he glances down. the wound looks worse
      than he was imagining, is far more than just a puncture. an uncanny
      darkness spreads across his chest. the gash is scabbing at the
      edges, bruised all around. his entire torso appears to be a mottled
      mess of purple and yellow, like a sort of fancy earth cheese.
      terezi’s blade cuts into it as easily as if it were.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she’s close enough that her
      breath washes over his face. it smells like shaving cream and
      tobacco, which is jarring to him, if not surprising. she is without
      her glasses, and so close that john notices things he hasn’t had
      occasion to before. like how lovely her eyes are. the length of her
      eyelashes, now that he’s really seeing them just inches from his
      face, is astounding to him. he has never thought of terezi as
      particularly feminine, at least in the way humans understand this
      idea. but he has never been forced to reckon with her features so
      unavoidably.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">the dark borders around the perimeter of
      her eyes are thicker and darker than what most trolls have. the
      tired bags under them are ditches in the shadows cast by her
      angular features, made more gaunt from hunger. when she blinks, her
      lashes brush the ridges of her cheekbones.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">her nostrils are flared, assessing the
      scent of his blood.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">he presses his eyes shut, and
      nods. he feels numb, clammy, jittering down to his bones from a
      particular sensation. a feeling he still seems to be denying to
      himself. as his own thoughts struggle to be honest with him, he
      cannot disguise the truth from me. what he is fighting is an
      intense desire to kiss her.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she grinds the sword between two
      of his ribs. the pain returns instantly, his acclimation erased
      nearly as quickly. he clenches his jaw hard, and his head spins.
      terezi’s blade catches against something.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">he can feel the tooth moving
      around against his flesh, the fibrous, spasmodic contractions of
      his muscles around it. when she wrenches the blade and pops the
      tooth out, he isn’t proud of the sound he makes.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">he finally opens his eyes. terezi’s arms
      are covered in his blood. she tosses the sword down to the floor of
      the car, in what suddenly strikes john as a fairly unhygienic
      surgical situation, and grabs his shirt with two clenched, red
      fists.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she peels him out of his hoodie
      and then his shredded t-shirt. he’s dizzy. his vision wavers,
      fades. it takes terezi’s sudden grip on his shoulder to bring him
      back from the brink. the brink of what, he doesn’t know.
      unconsciousness. canonic dissolution. he has no cognizance of what
      the poison in his veins does to someone, or that it’s even in his
      system. all he knows is that terezi is the only thing keeping him
      moored. she holds him firm, her thumb in the dip of his clavicle,
      her sharp nails etching scores in his back.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">he watches her tear his t-shirt into a
      long strip. he lifts his arms obediently as she wraps it around his
      chest and ties it off. her hands slide over the bandage and linger
      there. her fingers splay on his collarbones, her right hand resting
      above his heart. she slides her palms down his stomach, then around
      to his hips, leaving long bloody streaks along his torso. his
      blood, ten uneven tracks of it, one for each of her fingers.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">when his arms come down, they wrap around
      her shoulders. pulling her into his lap feels natural to him. a
      simple redirection of her momentum, to guide her closer. what comes
      less naturally is the first kiss. her lips are there, hovering just
      over his. yet he hesitates. his mind is still lying to itself,
      casting doubt on what it really wants. i don’t see a purpose in
      allowing his self-deceit to continue for much longer. it’s wrong to
      contradict one’s true thoughts and feelings. irrational. unbecoming
      of an existence governed by free will.</p>

      <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">he nods stupidly, and leans
      forward to kiss her. terezi attacks, closing the gap between them
      swiftly. she bites into his mouth, drawing blood when she sucks his
      lower lip. he twists his hands in the fabric of her shirt so hard
      it rides up her back.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">john can’t tell if it’s the pain or the
      arousal that’s emboldening him. it is neither. he is simply being
      barred from ignoring his true thoughts. even without the aid of a
      juju, he is fortunate enough to be blessed with the only true form
      of divinity. to be released from the prison of nonsensical
      inhibitions which so often psychologically hobble the more
      primitive forms of life. in his newfound clarity he discovers
      bravery, pulls terezi’s shirt off all the way, and does what he
      really wants to do, which is ghost his hands all the way up the
      curve of her spine.</p>
      <p class="calliope-dead">she sighs into his mouth.</p>

      him a chance to say anything else for a while, stupid or
