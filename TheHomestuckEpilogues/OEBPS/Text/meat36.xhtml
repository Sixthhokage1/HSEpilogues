      <p class="no-indent dirk"><span class="opener type-hs-opener-rg type-hs-opener-sm">S</span>o it turns
      out that “home” is an entirely abstract concept. A state of mind,
      if you will, rather than a literal, physical construct that can
      make you feel one way or the other. Terezi’s been gone long enough
      that her friends seem like strangers: entangled in relationship
      dynamics that she’s obliquely excluded from, embroiled in petty
      feuds, obsessed with politics.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Oh, do you want to know how those petty feuds and
      political obsessions turned out by the way? I thought it was pretty
      obvious, but I’ll say what’s up anyway.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Jane swept the election, of course. I told you I
      was going to win. After Jake’s incoherent and scandalous heel-turn
      at Karkat’s ill-fated rally, no amount of esoteric,
      three-dimensional jpeg artefacts could have salvaged the Vantas
      campaign. Besides, Dave and Karkat now have other concerns. Mainly
      that their BFF Jade has been in a coma for an entire month. They’ve
      been in and out of the hospital handling her affairs. Her next of
      kin is listed as John Egbert, and no one’s seen him in ages. It’s
      like he just disappeared suddenly. Like some great hand came out of
      the sky and crossed his name off the big list of guys we ever need
      to give a shit about anymore.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Terezi heard about Jade from a rather harried
      Kanaya, who is doubtlessly run ragged from the hot-potato plot
      circles that I’ve been sending her on for weeks to stop her from
      reading me the riot act for “kidnapping” her lovely wife. The woman
      is obviously hysterical and needs to chill the fuck out. I mean,
      she’s hysterical because I’ve been specifically and deliberately
      causing her to be that way, sure. But still. She should be fine
      soon enough.</p>
      <p class="dirk">It takes Terezi a couple days to work up the...</p>
      <p class="dirk">The <em>what</em>, exactly? What is she supposed to
      be feeling right now? I’m not sure myself. Maybe I should take a
      minute to think about the thing you’re supposed to feel when
      someone goes through whatever the hell it was she just went
      through. If I come up with any ideas, I could easily do her the
      favor of helping her feel it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Whatever it is she’s supposed to feel, what she
      actually feels is empty. Colorless, dried up, as she walks beneath
      a holographic billboard displaying Jane’s glorious victory speech.
      The ceremony accompanying the speech is patently absurd, stuffed
      with so much pomp and circumstance that Terezi’s nose can’t make
      sense of what she’s supposed to be looking at. It’s all just light
      and color, signifying nothing.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Her internal smelloscope is so discombobulated from
      the onslaught of pastry-themed floats, and Jane’s tearful soliloquy
      on the Legacy of Responsibility she is about to inherit, that she
      mistakes the familiar figure standing in front of the hospital for
      someone else entirely.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy turns around and blinks in
      confusion. Terezi blinks back. Kanaya had warned her that Roxy had
      been going through some changes, but this still takes her by
      surprise.</p>
      <p class="dirk">So, in her defense, this was an honest mistake to
      make. Dave gets half of his genetics from Roxy, after all, and
      since her big heart-to-heart about the personal politics of queer
      onion metaphors, and ten stages of galaxy-braining through the many
      vicissitudes of the phrase “no homo,” Roxy has decided to really
      step up her gender experimentation. I guess at this point she’s
      gone beyond Stage Ten. Which I imagine is somewhat like reaching
      Super Saiyan 2 of gender, and then going even further beyond.</p>
      <p class="dirk">She’s got the Shades™ now, and sports one of those
      sweep-over hipster cuts Dave loves so much. Nothing ambiguous about
      this presentation, although if I’m being totally real, it’s a bit
      derivative. Anyway, I can’t complain too much about her decision to
      crib the Strider style, since, you know. She’s family. Besides, I’m
      T-minus ten hours from fucking off this gay Earth forever. It’s her
      life, her gender, her style—she can be whatever the fuck she
      wants.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Roxy’s whole face lights up when she sees
      Terezi.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi’s jaw tightens. She’s not ready to
      hear any words that remind her of those few hours with John. Her
      hand goes to her pocket, where she’s keeping the wallet. She traces
      the contours of it with her thumb and forces a smile.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy seems almost effusive despite the
      circumstances. An earthy, genuine effusiveness that lights her up
      from inside. Terezi’s head is filled with stories about a different
      version of Roxy—the polar opposite of the one standing in front of
      her.</p>

      knows that’s dumb. This is just a motion you go through. John would
      definitely want to be here, though, and technically Terezi is
      taking him with her. He may be in her pocket, but lately she’s been
      feeling more like he’s under her skin. She hasn’t told anyone what
      happened. But at least she knows she can look at him whenever she
      wants.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi startles a bit when her phone
      buzzes. Who would even be messaging her now, when the only person
      she ever talked to is currently dead in her other pocket? She’s
      intrigued, but she thinks better of worrying about it. It’d be rude
      to look at her phone while she’s in the middle of a
      conversation.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh that reminds me!</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: have u seen john lately?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi’s heart skips a beat. It’s almost

      <p class="no-indent dirk">No one else has asked yet.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Roxy gives a shrug. A conflicted look crosses her
      face, but I can’t see past it. With the Dead Cherub out of the
      picture, the aura of void surrounding Roxy once again is
      impenetrable. Those baller shades aren’t exactly improving my odds
      of reading her, either. I’ll say again what I’ve always felt about
      her on some level: some riddles were never meant to be solved.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: he went back to the medium a while ago

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy pinches her lips together and
      examines Terezi over the rim of her sunglasses for a moment.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Maybe, having watched her own friend group suffer
      stress fractures recently, she understands the weight of those
      words as uttered by this specific person. Because Terezi is a
      fixer, and it has been a very difficult lesson for her to learn
      that some things are simply out of her control. Maybe it’s just
      that Roxy can hear the bone-deep sorrow in her voice.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-indent dirk">Whatever was bothering Roxy, it passes
      quickly, and he says nothing about it. He puts his hand on Terezi’s
      shoulder and gives it a warm clap. The fraternal kind, which a
      couple of solid dudes might exchange after having just “bro’ed
      out.” It’s convincing, actually. Reasonably authentic, and quite
      masculine. He’s off to a great start exhibiting the mannerisms
      associated with his chosen gender. I’m genuinely proud of him.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">As soon as Roxy’s gone, Terezi regrets
      lying to him about John. It’s a hard secret to keep, but probably a
      harder one to reveal. Maybe it would have been better if she
      <em>had</em> run into Dave instead of Roxy. It would have been
      easier to confide something like that to Dave, wouldn’t it? Well,
      <em>maybe</em> it would have been easier. Years ago, in a different
      timeline. And even then, she messed that up, didn’t she? But we
      can’t beat ourselves up too much for our teen mistakes. Let alone
      the stuff we can’t even remember, because it technically never even
      happened to us. We have enough to worry about as it is, right,
      Terezi?</p>

      your wallet. And we’ve already managed to strike such a nice
      metatextual rapport. So hear me out.</p>
      <p class="dirk">I know that you’ve always felt out of step here on
      Earth C. I know that you could easily put on a brilliant act that
      would fool everyone. You could potentially do that for the rest of
      your life. But it will eat into you, hollow you out like a
      parasite, because you’ll always refuse to allow yourself to be
      understood.</p>
      <p class="dirk">You know you’ll never be happy here. And neither
      will I. Because this place isn’t for people like us.</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">You’ll see, if you come with us.</p>
      <p class="dirk">Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t you bring him with
      you?</p>

      <p class="no-indent dirk">Yeah. You saved his body for a reason,
      right? Maybe it doesn’t even have to be the end for him. Endings
      are kind of overrated anyway.</p>
      <p class="dirk">I’ll give you some time to think about it. My door
      is open, but not for long.</p>
      <p class="dirk">And I do give her the time. I ease the throttle
      back a bit, just enough so that I’m not whispering directly into
      her ear when she slips the wallet out of her pocket. She clutches
      it so hard in her palm that she’s digging dents into the leather,
      and bites her lip. The gentle breeze is all she can hear. It’s
      louder than my voice, and in some understated way, makes my case
      for me more persuasively. She knows I’m right.</p>
