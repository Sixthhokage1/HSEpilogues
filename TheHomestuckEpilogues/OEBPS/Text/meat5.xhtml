      of the Cantown Memorial Arena are packed front to back with
      audience members from every kingdom. Presently the crowd is going
      nuts, enthralled by Jake English’s skillful posing and mollified by
      the deeply theatrical stage dive that Dirk has just taken onto the
      mat. Dirk, in fact, has unquestioningly eaten shit. His shit eating
      was so brutal that no one, except maybe Jake, cares that he’s
      taking a phone call in the middle of a live broadcast. And no one
      should, really. The broadcast has been going for three hours
      already.</p>
      <p>Dave takes a seat on the couch, right in Karkat’s butt groove.
      He observes his battered ecto-father, who is lying inside a wreath
      of busted robot limbs like a piece of absolute garbage.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: bro im watching you on the tube and i gotta
      say</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: while the beatdown you just received was as
      thorough as it was humiliating im afraid as usual the solution to
      this problem should probably not involve your decapitation</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: you fucking drama queen</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Damn.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Are you sure?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: jake just kicked your ass</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: thats really all there is to say on the
      matter</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re probably right.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: But still not entirely sure we should be so
      quick to rule out my beheading as a catchall solution to any given
      problem.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It really could save us all a lot of trouble
      in the future. Especially me.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: its really amazing how this meme we have
      going here continues to be exactly as funny as the day it was
      established</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Isn’t it always though?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: by the way</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: how DID you get your ass kicked so bad</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: jake sucks and his raps are fucking awful</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: please tell me this garbage show is as rigged
      as it looks</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">On the TV, Dirk makes an elegant hand sign
      that once might have represented solidarity with some ancient
      coastal rap group but now has been utterly divorced from its
      cultural context here on Earth C. The camera pans away from him and
      over the crowd. It zooms in on a young crocodile wearing an
      oversized T-shirt with Jake’s highly marketable ass plastered over
      it and the phrase “Tally ho” written in big bubble letters.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Dave, there’s such a thing as
      showmanship.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m sure I don’t need to explain this to you,
      of all people.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: ok cool its fake just making sure</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sigh.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: We really don’t like to use that word.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: lmao ok</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Holding back a little to achieve certain
      results doesn’t necessarily mean you’re participating in a farce or
      rigging the event.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: We do this all the time. We hold back our
      thoughts, our true feelings, our full potential. We disguise how
      much we know about what and when, for many purposes. To ease
      relations, to let others behave naturally and make up their minds
      without undue intervention. To wait for the right moments to show
      our hands, to pick our battles.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: In life, there are many reasons to show
      restraint, which would never be regarded as an attempt to rig
      reality.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: oof</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: my dog you are full of some SHIT today arent
      you</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Absolutely.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: And when it comes to theater, there are just
      as many reasons for restraint. To build tension. To set the stage.
      To give the people someone to root against.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: is that what youre doing now</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: making people root against you</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: What, by losing a round? No, man. That’s just
      standard pacing stuff when it comes to battlecraft.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: no i mean by holding up the whole fight by
      talking to me</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i can see you on tv</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: theyre booing you dude</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">The crowd has indeed finally exhausted both
      its patience and its thirst for the ceaseless ogling of Jake’s
      impressive glutes. The camera swings around to focus on Dirk, who,
      since landing on his self-admittedly second-rate ass, has not moved
      except to make arcane, rap-related hand gestures.</p>
      <p>The excitable salamander manning the camera switches to a
      fish-eye lens for some unfathomable reason, giving the whole
      exchange an air of demented absurdity. Dirk’s sunglasses distort
      and stretch to dominate the entire screen.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then yes, I guess that is what I’m doing.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Dirk are you going to be much longer with
      your telephone call?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: The crowd is getting feisty... you didnt get
      too badly winded from our last scrum did you dirk?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Haha, no Jake. I’m fine. I’ll just be a
      minute.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: What about the agitated rabble? Theyre
      starting to throw things.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I don’t know. Do a dance or something. Sing a
      song.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: They love anything you do.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Ummm.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Ok sounds stupid but ill try.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake tips an imaginary hat toward center stage
      and begins doing the Charleston. Dave is subjected to an entire
      fish-eye lensful of Jake’s booty shorts flexing and constricting
      against his tanned thighs.</p>
      <p>Just as Dirk predicted, the crowd immediately loses its shit,
      except for a single carapacian in the front row, who continues to
      glower at Dirk with an expression of absolute and total
      contempt.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: why do you want people to hate you so
      much</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: its fucked up</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re reading way too much into it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: If I wanted another round of embarrassingly
      indulgent and mutually masturbatory psychoanalysis, I would have
      called my daughter instead.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: hm</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: do i need to point out how fucking weird what
      you just said was or can that start going without saying at this
      point</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think it can go without saying.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: nice</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: The point is, playing myself up as a villain
      figure in this hacky rap pageant has nothing to do with getting
      people to dislike me. Besides, everyone loves a good villain. When
      they boo, they don’t really mean it.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think you’d be surprised by how popular I
      actually am.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i dunno man</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Something flies out of the audience and smacks
      Dirk in the side of the head before flopping out of view of the
      camera. He doesn’t react, or make a facial expression at all.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: did...</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: did someone just throw a diaper at you</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: There’s gonna be some diapers, yeah.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: sounds bad</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: The point is, this is much less about me, and
      more about providing a foil for Jake’s heroism and charisma.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s very important that his popularity
      continues to be cultivated, to maximize his political capital.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: political capital</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: what the fuck are...</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: ok how long have you known about the jane
      thing</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean is this something you have been
      planning for like</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: a long time or</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Planning is such an intense word.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: god damn it</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Look, let’s just say there have been some
      conversations.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Does that meet with your approval?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: jane is a shitty candidate dude</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: shes going to be so shitty</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I thought you’d feel that way.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I respectfully disagree.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i get shes a good friend of yours and all but
      even you have to admit how far up her own ass she is</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Of course. I consider it to be among her best
      qualifications for the job.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: christ</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: ok if nothing else have you at least taken
      into account the DEVASTATION to the economy this will cause???</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know perfectly well how much we differ on
      fiscal policy.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Maybe this isn’t the best time for one of our
      epic debates on the subject?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah what was i thinking</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: wasting the time of the dude currently
      holding up a televised rap contest so bad hes gettin diapers thrown
      at him</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Dave, I think if you search your soul, you’ll
      come to the same conclusion I have. Jane is just what this planet
      needs.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: We’ve all had our fun here, but it’s easy to
      overlook the fact that civilization on Earth C is hardly a
      sustainable proposition.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Just beneath the surface, it’s quite a
      dangerous and unstable place.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i know that</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: which is why actually i think it would be
      cool to have a president that is good instead of bad</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’s not as great as you think.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: what</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: who</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: obama??</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: how dare you</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: No, fool.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Karkat.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: oh</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think your heart is in the right place, but
      the dude is a complete amateur.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’ll get eaten alive. I also have a hard
      time imagining he even wants the job.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Really, it’s an awful idea for him to even
      run. Think about how much it’s going to inflame the interspecies
      tensions on this planet. Is that what you want?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m happy for both of you, really. It’s nice
      that you encourage and support each other in this way. But you’re
      sending him on a fool’s errand which can only end badly.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dave opens his mouth to argue, but something
      else occurs to him.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: wait</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: how do you even know hes entering the
      race</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: we like just decided this</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: A competent political operative has his
      ways.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Besides, it was always pretty obvious to me
      you’d react this way the moment the announcement was made.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: ok thats kinda creepy i guess but it doesnt
      change anything</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: hes running for president and hes going to
      fuckin win end of story</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Fair enough.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: though now im wondering</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: since you and jane have been planning this
      for a while how many key endorsements have you locked up</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: cause if youve already got jake on your side
      then i guess we might as well just fucking quit</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I wouldn’t worry about that.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: He and I don’t quite have the rapport we once
      did.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’s “over me” and doesn’t spare
      opportunities to make ostentatious demonstration of this claim.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: um</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Basically he doesn’t like being told what to
      do. Especially not by me.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: So it’s fair to say as of now, he’s still
      fully in play.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Not that I should be encouraging you,
      really.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: you are one doubletalking son of a bitch you
      know that</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i cant tell if you dont want us to run or are
      reverse psychology mindfucking us into running</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Does it matter?</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i guess not</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: not like i can just stand around and wait for
      president crocker to like</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: write fucking grammar laws into the
      constitution</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Good.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s a heroic attitude to have, which I’m
      pleased to hear. Even if your plan is stupid, which it is, and even
      if Karkat would be an atrocious president, which he would.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: nuh uh</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry to cut this short, but diapers are
      starting to come down pretty hard right now, and some of them
      haven’t even had their babies removed.</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: what</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: That was a joke.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Goodbye, Dave.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Dirk hangs up the phone and wipes off his
      face. The mood in Cantown Memorial Arena is tense, snapping and
      popping from the dual cooling and heating of the audience’s
      expectations and tempers. An uneven silence begins to fall over the
      stadium as Dirk hops to his feet. Jake can’t help but watch the
      motion, raking his eyes over the muscles shifting beneath the skin
      of Dirk’s neck and arms.</p>
      <p>There is something implacably magnificent about Dirk Strider,
      Jake thinks, untamed like a wild game beast of incredible size and
      strength. Of course, their history together is never far from
      Jake’s mind, however many years it’s been since their last tussle
      of an amorous nature. The old dramas and triumphs in the days of
      Sburb. Dirk’s companionship has been taxing to the heart, to say
      the least, and yet he’s taught Jake so much—about combat,
      philosophy, life, love.</p>
      <p>But sometimes, despite their checkered and problematic past,
      Jakes wishes that he could seize Dirk by the proverbial horns and
      wrest him bodily into becoming a much more agreeable fellow. Then
      again, who would Dirk be if he weren’t so contentious and
      imperious? Certainly not someone to inspire such wistful
      lollygagging, Jake cannot help but observe.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry for the momentary diversion, Jake. Now
      where were we?</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Momentary??? Gadzooks man you were on the
      phone for half a friggin hour!</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: I know you like to get the crowd all hot and
      bothered but we are supposed to be professionals here!</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re right, my bad. Won’t happen again.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: How about you kick off the next round?</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: I bet this crowd will settle its shit right
      down the moment you drop the latest rhymes you’ve been tinkering
      with.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know the ones.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: Gasp.</p>
      <p class="jake">JAKE: You dont mean...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh. But I DO.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jake’s face lights up. He composes himself,
      adjusting a bow tie, although he is not wearing one, and making a
      vague gesture like he’s twirling one end of that mustache Dirk has
      not yet let him grow. Dirk lets him go with a gentle smile, like
      the sort you’d give to a dog for performing a trick adequately.
      Jake responds to the signal like an Olympic athlete hearing the
      starter pistol. He was born for this.</p>

      settled its shit right down. This is not due to any accidental
      brilliance on the part of Jake English, but rather due to an
      abashed but loyal brand of pity, the kind a devoted fan cannot help
      but feel when they see a beloved celebrity make an ass out of
      themselves during a live broadcast they have waited two and a half
      years in line to buy a ticket for.</p>
      <p>Dirk’s phone begins going off again.</p>

      <p class="jake">JAKE: When the splendid lads and ladies ask me “how

      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Whoops. Jake, sorry to cut you off...</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Looks like I’m getting another call. Really
      need to take this one.</p>
      <p class="dirk">DIRK: Gonna have to wrap this battle up sooner than
      scheduled.</p>

      <p class="no-indent">With a casual flick of his wrist, Dirk snaps
      out a bright red tranquilizer handgun and shoots Jake in the neck.
      Jake’s glasses crack when he hits the mat. A chorus of boos rises
      up from the crowd like groundwater. Dirk artfully dodges a bucket
      of obscene troll fluid to field yet another very important personal
      call.</p>
