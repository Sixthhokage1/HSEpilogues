      <p class="Command">&gt; JOHN: Zap to your final destination.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">Where the hell are you?</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="dave">DAVE: where the hell are we</p>
      <p class="dave">DAVE: i cant see shit</p>
      <p class="jade">JADE: shhh!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">It’s dark. Not like “someone turned out the
      lights out” dark. More like “someone destroyed the concept of light
      at its very source” dark. It’s a darkness that fills up your skull.
      Jake puts this more eloquently, as always:</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="jake">JAKE: By golly it is indeed dark as fuck.</p>
      <p class="roxy">ROXY: shoosh!!!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">Jade breaks off from the group. She moves
      through the air gracefully, ears twitching as she sniffs through
      space like a bloodhound. “There!” she exclaims, and points down.
      All the way down.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Look down.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">All the way down beneath you there is a light
      source. Gray, focused—like a spotlight, except that it’s folded
      over the curvature of the space beneath it. At the center of it
      stands teenage Lord English, all decked out in his ostentatious god
      tier jammies. Gamzee’s there too, for some unfathomably stupid
      reason. There’s a robot bunny chilling out on top of a chest,
      lookin’ cool and kicking its cute little bunny legs back and forth.
      You hope that neither of these unexpected dramatis personae will
      play a role in the coming battle, because it wouldn’t feel right
      whaling on either of them at this point.</p>
      <p>Lord English is holding something that looks like... Lil Cal?
      It’s definitely Lil Cal, and Lord English is definitely waltzing
      around with it in his little spotlight in the middle of the
      nowhere, swinging the puppet around by both its floppy arms. Well,
      rather, he <em>was</em> waltzing around. He stopped the moment you
      looked at him.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Behold your adversary.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">

      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">You simply refuse to answer his question.
      Instead, you do something so much better. Something that will make
      both his inevitable fate and your regard for his character
      incontrovertibly clear.</p>
      <p class="Command">&gt; Give him a thumbs-down.</p>
      <p class="no-indent">It’s a textbook thumbs-down. Better, actually.
      The kind you can’t really teach. Lord English drops the puppet. For
      a moment he looks shocked, maybe even a little afraid, but it
      passes quickly. He starts laughing.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="john">JOHN: uh.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: NEVERMIND. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: IT WAS FORETOLD. BY THE MASTERPIECE I
      MADE. WHEN I WAS BUT A BOY.</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: what?</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: BE QUIET.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: I’LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT YOU JUST
      INTERRUPTED A GROUNDBREAKING INTERPRETIVE ART PIECE.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND.
      PERFORMED ONLY ONCE. AND MADE MORE VALUABLE FOR ITS RARENESS.</p>
      <p class="john">JOHN: wow.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: I SAID SHUT UP. IT’S RUDE TO TALK
      THROUGH THE OVERTURE.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: BUT DON’T WORRY. ALTHOUGH YOU MISSED
      MY VERY IMPORTANT DANCE DEMONSTRATION.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: WHICH WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED ACT OF
      GENIUS. AND NOT AT ALL EMBARRASSING.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: NOW YOU WILL PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING
      EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">The young Lord’s face begins to distort. The
      unhinging of his jaw reverberates in the empty space. He laughs
      through the remainder of his nefarious soliloquy, which he has
      possibly prepared in advance for this moment.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: BY NOW, SURELY MANY HAVE WITNESSED MY
      MASTERPIECE.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: AS IT HAS CIRCULATED THROUGH THE
      BLACK VEINS. OF THE DARK WEB.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: TRILLIONS HAVE WITNESSED ITS MAJESTY.
      HATERS AND FOOLS ALIKE.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: AND THEY HAVE BEEN RENDERED
      *AGOG*.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: BY MY ART VIRTUOSITY. MY
      CLAYSMANSHIP. AND MY WRESTLING MOVES.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: BUT NOW. THE TIME HAS COME.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: FOR EVERYONE TO SHUT UP ABOUT HOW
      GREAT MY MASTERPIECE WAS.</p>
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: AND THE TIME IS NOW AT HAND...</p>
      </div>
      <p class="no-indent">His laughter turns into a low, cracked gurgle.
      It spikes towards you in waves, distorts and pitches low. He is
      beyond pleased with himself, and with the line he is about to
      deliver.</p>
      <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small">
      <p class="caliborn">CALIBORN: FOR YOU ALL TO *BECOME* MY
